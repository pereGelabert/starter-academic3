abstract: Mountain forests face important threats from global change and
  spatio-temporal variation in tree height can help to monitor these effects. In
  this study, we used the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation space-borne
  laser sensor to examine the relationship between maximum tree height and
  elevation, and the role of climate, in the main European mountain ranges. We
  found a piecewise relationship between elevation and maximum tree height in
  all mountain ranges, supporting the existence of a common breakpoint that
  marks the beginning of tree development limitations. Temperature and
  precipitation were identified as the most important drivers of tree height
  variation. Additionally, we predicted significant upward displacement of the
  breakpoint for the period 2080-2100 under climate change scenarios,
  potentially increasing the area without growth limitations for trees. These
  findings contribute to understanding the impacts of global warming on mountain
  forest ecosystems and provide insights for their monitoring and management.
