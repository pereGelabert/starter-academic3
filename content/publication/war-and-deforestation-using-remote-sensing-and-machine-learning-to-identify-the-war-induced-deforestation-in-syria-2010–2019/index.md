abstract: Armed conflicts and other types of violence are key drivers of
  human-induced landscape change. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in
  a prolonged and devastating armed conflict causing immense human suffering and
  extensive destruction. As a result, over five million people have been forced
  to seek refuge outside the country’s borders, while more than six million have
  been internally displaced. This study focuses on examining the impact of this
  conflict on forest cover by identifying the drivers of forest change. To
  assess this change, Landsat and PALSAR imagery were used to differentiate
  between forested and non-forested areas. Spectral information was synthetized
  using the Tasseled Cap transformation and the time series data was simplified
  and despiked using the LandTrendr algorithm. Our results show that between
  2010 and 2019 there was a substantial decrease of 19.3% in forest cover,
  predominantly concentrated in the northwestern region of Syria. This decline
  was induced by the armed conflict, with several key drivers contributing to
  the decline, such as illegal logging activities conducted by both locals and
  refugees living in nearby forest areas. Drivers such as proximity to refugee
  camps, roads, and settlements played an important role in producing this
  change by facilitating access to forests. In addition, the occurrence of
  explosive events such as bombings and shelling near forests also contributed
  to this decline by causing forest fires. To mitigate further deforestation and
  reduce dependence on forests for fuel, it is crucial for local governments in
  the post-conflict period to offer sustainable alternatives for heating and
  cooking to both the local populations and refugees. Additionally, governments
  are recommended to enforce strict laws and regulations to protect forests and
  combat illegal logging activities. These measures are essential for preserving
  and restoring forests, promoting environmental sustainability, and ensuring
  the well-being of both displaced populations and local communities.
