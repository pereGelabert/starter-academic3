abstract: Forest fires can change forest structure and composition, and
  low-density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) can be a valuable tool for
  evaluating post-fire vegetation response. The aim of this study is to analyze
  the structural diversity differences in Mediterranean Pinus halepensis Mill.
  forests affected by wildfires on different dates from 1986 to 2009. Several
  types of ALS metrics, such as the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Height
  Diversity Index (LHDI), the LiDAR Height Evenness Index (LHEI), and vertical
  and horizontal continuity of vegetation, as well as topographic metrics, were
  obtained in raster format from low point density data. In order to map burned
  and unburned areas, differentiate fire occurrence dates, and distinguish
  between old and more recent fires, a sample of pixels was previously selected
  to assess the existence of differences in forest structure using the
  Kruskal–Wallis test. Then, k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN), support
  vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers were compared to
  select the most accurate technique. The results showed that, in more recent
  fires, around 70% of the laser returns came from grass and shrub layers,
  yielding low LHDI and LHEI values (0.37–0.65 and 0.28–0.46, respectively). In
  contrast, the areas burned more than 20 years ago had higher LHDI and LHEI
  values due to the growth of the shrub and tree strata. The classification of
  burned and unburned areas yielded an overall accuracy of 89.64% using the RF
  method. SVM was the best classifier for identifying the structural differences
  between fires occurring on different dates, with an overall accuracy of
  68.79%. Furthermore, SVM yielded an overall accuracy of 75.49% for the
  classification between old and more recent fires.
