abstract: In this work we showcase the in-progress results from the FirePATHS project (PID2020-116556RA-I00). The project aims to assess the evolution of fire danger under different emission and forest management scenarios through the explicit interaction of the climate-vegetation-fire system. For this purpose, a methodological framework combining different simulation models of the elements of this system is proposed. The core of the process lies in the modeling of vegetation dynamics at stand scale according to different trajectories of climatic evolution to characterize the state and typology of fuels and the subsequent simulation of potential fire behavior during the 21st century. We analyzed a set of 114 Pinus halepensis plots, surveyed in the field during 2017;  68 plots burned during the summer of 1994 and 46 unburned control stands. We used the medfate model to simulate forest functioning and dynamics, which provides the necessary fuel model parameters to be entered into fire behavior models (Fuel Characteristics Classification System, implemented in medfate as well). The combination of these two approaches provides time-varying estimates of fire behavior metrics (e.g., flame length or rate of spread). The simulation was conducted under SSP climate scenarios (SSP 126, 245, 370 and 585) depicting different levels of climate warming, vegetation dynamics and, hence, fire danger. Likewise, we devised a set of forest management prescriptions aimed at reducing climate vulnerability of tree communities and reducing extreme wildfire potentials. A baseline scenario with no management was also assessed. We observed very contrasting trajectories between burned and control stands, with the first leading to increasing fuel loads, except in SSP 585. Fire potentials depicted a significant increase in surface fire behavior, with adaptive and mitigation management being able to mitigate it to some extent
