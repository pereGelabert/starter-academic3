abstract: Despite escalating expenditures in firefighting, extreme fire events
  continue to pose a major threat to ecosystem services and human communities in
  Mediterranean areas. Developing a safe and effective fire response is
  paramount to efficiently restrict fire spread, reduce negative effects to
  natural values, prevent residential housing losses, and avoid causalties.
  Though current fire policies in most countries demand full suppression, few
  studies have attempted to identify the strategic locations where firefighting
  efforts would likely contain catastrophic fire events. The success in
  containing those fires that escape initial attack is determined by diverse
  structural factors such as ground accessibility, airborne support, barriers to
  surface fire spread, and vegetation impedance. In this study, we predicted the
  success in fire containment across Catalonia (northeastern Spain) using a
  model generated with random forest from detailed geospatial data and a set of
  73 fire perimeters for the period 2008â€“2016. The model attained a high
  predictive performance (AUC = 0.88), and the results were provided at fine
  resolution (25 m) for the entire study area (32,108 km2). The highest success
  rates were found in agricultural plains along the nonburnable barriers such as
  major road corridors and largest rivers. Low levels of containment likelihood
  were predicted for dense forest lands and steep-relief mountainous areas. The
  results can assist in suppression resource pre-positioning and extended attack
  decision making, but also in strategic fuels management oriented at creating
  defensive locations and fragmenting the landscape in operational firefighting
  areas. Our modeling workflow and methods may serve as a baseline to generate
  locally adapted models in fire-prone areas elsewhere.
