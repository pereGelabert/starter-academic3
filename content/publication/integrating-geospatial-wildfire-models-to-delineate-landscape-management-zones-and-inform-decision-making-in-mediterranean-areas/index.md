abstract: Despite the abundant firefighting resources deployed to reinforce the
  fire exclusion policy, extreme events continue to cause substantial losses in
  Mediterranean regions. These catastrophic wildfires question the
  merely-reactive response, while science-based decision-making advocates for a
  paradigm shift towards a long-term solution to coexist with fire.
  Comprehensive management solutions integrate multiple efforts to minimize the
  number of escaped wildfires in fire ignition hotspots, restrict large fire
  spread across the landscape, and prevent losses to valued resources and
  assets. This study develops a wildfire management zone (WMZ) delineation
  framework to inform decision-making in fire-prone Mediterranean landscapes.
  First, we combined modeling outcomes of wildfire occurrence, initial attack
  success, and wildfire transmission to communities to segment the landscape in
  WMZ blocks. We assumed the worst-case scenario in terms of fire simultaneity
  and weather conditions to implement the models. The geospatial outcomes were
  assembled and classified into four primary archetypes, and we then designated
  the most suitable risk mitigation strategies for each management unit. The
  WMZs included (1) comprehensive management, (2) human ignition prevention, (3)
  intensive fuel management, and (4) fire reintroduction areas. Finally, we
  downscaled within zones to assign specific management prescriptions to the
  different areas. The results were presented in a set of cross-scale maps to
  assist in designing risk management plans and raise social awareness. The
  methodological framework developed in this study may be valuable to help
  mitigate risk in fire-prone Mediterranean areas, but also in other regions in
  which similar total suppression policies fail to reduce catastrophic wildfire
  losses.
