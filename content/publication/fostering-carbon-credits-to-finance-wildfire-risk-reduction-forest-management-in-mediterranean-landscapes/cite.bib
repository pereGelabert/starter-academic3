	abstract = {Aims Grasslands are the world's most extensive terrestrial ecosystem, and are a major feed source for livestock. Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and groundbased sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development. Important Findings The retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation.},

	abstract = {Secondary succession after farmland abandonment has become a common process in north Mediterranean countries, especially in mountain areas. In this paper, a methodology is tested which combines Markov chains and logistic multivariate regression to model secondary succession after farmland abandonment in environments where abiotic constraints play a major role, like mountain areas. In such landscapes, a decay in the succession rate with time is usually found, as the best locations are progressively occupied. This is frequently addressed using non-stationary Markov chains. Here, we test if the combination of logistic multivariate regression with Markov chains, however, allows for spatially distributed transitions probabilities based on abiotic factors and therefore, it is able to reproduce the preferential colonization of the most favourable locations. The model is tested in the Ijuez Valley in the Spanish Pyrenees, which underwent generalized land abandonment during the 1950s. Results confirm a substantial improvement in the prediction success of the Markov-logistic model when compared to the standard Markov chain approach. As a result, the decay in the succession rate can be successfully modelled. The specific results for our study area are discussed further in an ecological context. The methodology proposed is applicable to any landscape where vegetation dynamics are constrained by environmental factors. However, the inclusion of land use as an explanatory factor would be necessary in human-managed landscapes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At over 40 years, the Landsat satellites provide the longest temporal record of space-based land surface observations, and the successful 2013 launch of the Landsat-8 is continuing this legacy. Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration, signal to noise characteristics, higher 12-bit radiometric resolution, and spectrally narrower wavebands than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +). Reflective wavelength differences between the two Landsat sensors depend also on the surface reflectance and atmospheric state which are difficult to model comprehensively. The orbit and sensing geometries of the Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM + provide swath edge overlapping paths sensed only one day apart. The overlap regions are sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations so Landsat bi-directional reflectance effects are evident but approximately balanced between the two sensors when large amounts of time series data are considered. Taking advantage of this configuration a total of 59 million 30 m corresponding sensor observations extracted from 6317 Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI images acquired over three winter and three summer months for all the conterminous United States (CONUS) are compared. Results considering different stages of cloud and saturation filtering, and filtering to reduce one day surface state differences, demonstrate the importance of appropriate per-pixel data screening. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are compared and their differences quantified. On average the OLI TOA reflectance is greater than the ETM + TOA reflectance for all bands, with greatest differences in the near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared bands due to the quite different spectral response functions between the sensors. The atmospheric correction reduces the mean difference in the NIR and shortwave infrared but increases the mean difference in the visible bands. Regardless of whether TOA or surface reflectance are used to generate NDVI, on average, for vegetated soil and vegetation surfaces (0 ≤ NDVI ≤ 1), the OLI NDVI is greater than the ETM + NDVI. Statistical functions to transform between the comparable sensor bands and sensor NDVI values are presented so that the user community may apply them in their own research to improve temporal continuity between the Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI sensor data. The transformation functions were developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and were fit quite reliably (r2 values {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.7 for the reflectance data and {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.9 for the NDVI data, p-values {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001).},

	abstract = {We review the effects of climate variability and land use/land cover changes in the Central Spanish Pyrenees at different spatial and temporal scales. Paleoclimatic studies based upon multi-proxy analyses of lacustrine, glacial and speleothematic deposits, among others, have demonstrated the occurrence of intense climatic fluctuations not only during the Late Upper Pleistocene associated to deglaciation, but also during the Holocene, affecting plant cover distribution, runoff generation, flood frequency, and the spatial organization of human activities, particularly during the 8.2 event, the Bronze Age, the Medieval Climatic Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. The study of the impact of human activity on landscape dynamics during the last 150 years has revealed dramatic changes in plant cover structure and distribution, in both the montane and the sub-alpine belts and, consequently, changes in runoff generation, soil erosion intensity, and sediment sources, whatever the spatial scale used. In general, the maximum human pressure on the territory was reached during the middle of the 19th century, with the cultivation of most of the south-facing slopes up to approximately 1650 m a.s.l., and the frequent use of fire to control shrub colonization, resulting in intense soil erosion and degradation processes, as well as the development of braided rivers with a high torrentiality. Farmland abandonment since the beginning of the 20th century (and, particularly, since the 1960s) and the declining livestock pressure have favoured plant recolonization, with the expansion of shrubs and forests in the old cultivated and grazing areas, the human-induced reforestation of large hillslopes, and the treeline upward in the subalpine belt, in this latter case with the contribution of climate warming. The most outstanding consequences of such an evolution have been: (i) the sustained decline of discharge in the Pyrenean rivers since the 1970s because of increasing actual evapotranspiration; (ii) the spatial shrinkage of sediment source areas; (iii) the increasing uncoupled geomorphic dynamics between hillslopes and channels; (iv) the decreasing importance of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes in the fluvial regime of the Pyrenean rivers, with earlier onset of the high spring discharges; (v) the changes in reservoir hydrological dynamics and the need for new management policies; and (vi) the increasing scouring processes that affect most of the Pyrenean rivers. The studies carried out on Global Change and its consequences in the Central Pyrenees confirm the extreme complexity of interactions occurring in the natural systems, and the quick response of plant cover, runoff generation and soil erosion as a consequence of climatic and land use changes.},

	abstract = {The hydrological and geomorphic effects of land use/land cover changes, particularly those associated with vegetation regrowth after farmland abandonment were investigated in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The main focus was to assess the interactions among slope, catchment, basin, and fluvial channel processes over a range of spatial scales. In recent centuries most Mediterranean mountain areas have been subjected to significant human pressure through deforestation, cultivation of steep slopes, fires, and overgrazing. Depopulation commencing at the beginning of the 20th century, and particularly since the 1960s, has resulted in farmland abandonment and a reduction in livestock numbers, and this has led to an expansion of shrubs and forests. Studies in the Central Spanish Pyrenees, based on experimental plots and catchments, in large basins and fluvial channels, have confirmed that these land use changes have had hydrological and geomorphic consequences regardless of the spatial scale considered, and that processes occurring at any particular scale can be explained by such processes acting on other scales. Studies using experimental plots have demonstrated that during the period of greatest human pressure (mainly the 18th and 19th centuries), cultivation of steep slopes caused high runoff rates and extreme soil loss. Large parts of the small catchments behaved as runoff and sediment source areas, whereas the fluvial channels of large basins showed signs of high torrentiality (braided morphology, bare sedimentary bars, instability, and prevalence of bedload transport). Depopulation has concentrated most human pressure on the valley bottoms and specific locations such as resorts, whereas the remainder of the area has been affected by an almost generalized abandonment. Subsequent plant recolonization has resulted in a reduction of overland flow and declining soil erosion. At a catchment scale this has caused a reduction in sediment sources, and channel incision in the secondary streams. At the regional scale, the most important consequences include a reduction in the frequency of floods, reduced sediment yields, increasing stabilization of fluvial channels (colonization of sedimentary bars by riparian vegetation and a reduction in the braiding index), and stabilization of alluvial fans. These results demonstrate the complexity and multiscalar nature of the interactions among land use and runoff generation, soil erosion, sediment transport, and fluvial channel dynamics, and highlight the need to adopt a multiscale approach in other mountain areas of the world. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {During the last few years, the remote sensing community has been trying to address the need for global synthesis to support policy makers on issues such as deforestation or global climate change. Several global thematic products have been derived from large datasets of low-resolution remotely sensed data, the latter providing the best trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and cost. However, a standard procedure for the validation of such products has not been developed yet. This paper proposes a methodology, based on statistical indices derived from the widely used Error Matrix, to deal with the specific issue of the influence of the low spatial resolution of the dataset on the accuracy of the end-product, obtained with hard classification approaches. In order to analyse quantitatively the trade-off between omission and commission errors, we suggest the use of the 'Pareto Boundary', a method rooted in economics theory applied to decisions with multiple conflicting objectives. Starting from a high-resolution reference dataset, it is possible to determine the maximum user and producer's accuracy values (i.e. minimum omission and commission errors) that could be attained jointly by a low-resolution map. The method has been developed for the specific case of dichotomic classifications and it has been adopted in the evaluation of burned area maps derived from SPOT-VGT with Landsat ETM+ reference data. The use of the Pareto Boundary can help to understand whether the limited accuracy of a low spatial resolution map is given by poor performance of the classification algorithm or by the low resolution of the remotely sensed data, which had been classified. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that the hybrid classification approach, with an overall accuracy of 90\%, is superior to using a traditional maximum likelihood classifier, which generated an overall accuracy of 68\%. The hybrid classification results indicate that the landscape is dominated by bush and bamboo, while the maximum likelihood classification suggests a landscape that is predominantly grass covered.

Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6° N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, there have been large areas of agricultural land that were abandoned in Europe, producing significant social and environmental impacts. Land abandonment is a dynamic process, which is influenced by a complex range of drivers that vary over time and space. This process is driven by a combination of socio-economic, political, and environmental factors by which formerly cultivated fields are no longer economically viable under existing land-use and socio-economic conditions. The implications of land abandonment on biodiversity and other ecosystem services can be positive or negative depending on the conservation status of the area, agro-climatic conditions, and local factors. Therefore, the scope and extent of environmental impacts vary over time and location. Considering that land abandonment is a contentious issue in Europe, there is still growing need for research on this topic. This paper reviews (i) drivers and consequences of farmland abandonment in Europe, (ii) policy measures and tools developed by the European Union in relation to land abandonment process, (iii) the impacts and indicators that are used to assess ecosystem services that are related to land abandonment, and (iv) the methods by which socio-economic, environmental, and cultural values can be assessed.

The application of probabilistic methods is connected with extensive use of the terminology of probability theory. The reader will easily understand however that one speaks in fact about solving enumerative problems of discrete analysis. One of the primary research lines is the study of the limit properties of combinatorial objects manifested at the unlimited increase of the number of elements comprising such objects. It is often possible to represent the distributions of the characteristics of combinatorial objects as conditional distributions of the sums of independent random variables so that they can be studied using asymptotic methods in probability theory, namely limit theorems for sums of independent random variables.},

Field stand metrics were obtained within 45 plots, 30 m in diameter. A multiple regression analysis was performed in order to develop the models for mean height, squared mean diameter, basal area, timber volume, stand density and crown ratio, which led to the following R2 values: 0.87, 0.84, 0.89, 0.89, 0.48 and 0.69, respectively. ALS-derived metrics included in the models were maximum height, the 99th, 95th and 50th canopy height percentiles, the skewness, the kurtosis, the standard deviation, the coefficient of variation and the percentages of all and first returns from above 1 m of the ground surface. With the exception of stand density, the final models are appropriate to be used in forest management operations in Mediterranean Aleppo pine forest.

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an emerging remote-sensing technology with potential to assist in mapping, monitoring, and assessment of forest resources. Despite a growing body of peer-reviewed literature documenting the filtering methods of LiDAR data, there seems to be little information about qualitative and quantitative assessment of filtering methods to select the most appropriate to create digital elevation models with the final objective of normalizing the point cloud in forestry applications. Furthermore, most algorithms are proprietary and have high purchase costs, while a few are openly available and supported by published results. This paper compares the accuracy of seven discrete return LiDAR filtering methods, implemented in nonproprietary tools and software in classification of the point clouds provided by the Spanish National Plan for Aerial Orthophotography (PNOA). Two test sites in moderate to steep slopes and various land cover types were selected. The classification accuracy of each algorithm was assessed using 424 points classified by hand and located in different terrain slopes, cover types, point cloud densities, and scan angles. MCC filter presented the best overall performance with an 83.3\% of success rate and a Kappa index of 0.67. Compared to other filters, MCC and LAStools balanced quite well the error rates. Sprouted scrub with abandoned logs, stumps, and woody debris and terrain slopes over 15\&\#x00B0; were the most problematic cover types in filtering. However, the influence of point density and scan-angle variables in filtering is lower, as morphological methods are less sensitive to them.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2009.09.003},
	abstract = {A hybrid theoretical-empirical model has been developed for modelling the error in LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) of non-open terrain. The theoretical component seeks to model the propagation of the sample data error (SDE), i.e. the error from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data capture of ground sampled points in open terrain, towards interpolated points. The interpolation methods used for infilling gaps may produce a non-negligible error that is referred to as gridding error. In this case, interpolation is performed using an inverse distance weighting (IDW) method with the local support of the five closest neighbours, although it would be possible to utilize other interpolation methods. The empirical component refers to what is known as "information loss". This is the error purely due to modelling the continuous terrain surface from only a discrete number of points plus the error arising from the interpolation process. The SDE must be previously calculated from a suitable number of check points located in open terrain and assumes that the LiDAR point density was sufficiently high to neglect the gridding error. For model calibration, data for 29 study sites, 200×200 m in size, belonging to different areas around Almeria province, south-east Spain, were acquired by means of stereo photogrammetric methods. The developed methodology was validated against two different LiDAR datasets. The first dataset used was an Ordnance Survey (OS) LiDAR survey carried out over a region of Bristol in the UK. The second dataset was an area located at Gador mountain range, south of Almería province, Spain. Both terrain slope and sampling density were incorporated in the empirical component through the calibration phase, resulting in a very good agreement between predicted and observed data (R2= 0.9856 ; p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). In validation, Bristol observed vertical errors, corresponding to different LiDAR point densities, offered a reasonably good fit to the predicted errors. Even better results were achieved in the more rugged morphology of the Gador mountain range dataset. The findings presented in this article could be used as a guide for the selection of appropriate operational parameters (essentially point density in order to optimize survey cost), in projects related to LiDAR survey in non-open terrain, for instance those projects dealing with forestry applications. © 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe knowledge of the forest biomass reduction produced by a wildfire can assist in the estimation of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This study focuses on the estimation of biomass losses and CO2 emissions by combustion of Aleppo pine forest in a wildfire occurred in the municipality of Luna (Spain). The availability of low point density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data allowed the estimation of pre-fire aboveground forest biomass. A comparison of nine regression models was performed in order to relate the biomass, estimated in 46 field plots, to several independent variables extracted from the ALS data. The multivariate linear regression selected model, including the percentage of first returns above 2 m and 40th percentile of the return heights, was validated using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique (6.1 ton/ha root mean square error). Biomass losses were estimated in a three-phase approach: (i) wildfire severity was obtained using the difference normalized burn ratio , (ii) Aleppo pine forest was delimited using the National Forest Map and ALS data and (iii) burning efficiency factors were applied considering severity levels. Post-fire biomass was then transformed into CO2 emissions (426,754.8 ton). This study evidences the usefulness of low-density ALS data to accurately estimate pre-fire biomass, in order to assess CO2 emissions in a Mediterranean Aleppo pine forest.},

	abstract = {One prerequisite to the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) across disciplines is differentiating ground from nonground returns. The objective was to automatically and objectively classify points within unclassified LiDAR point clouds, with few model parameters and minimal postprocessing. Presented is an automated method for classifying LiDAR returns as ground or nonground in forested environments occurring in complex terrains. Multiscale curvature classification (MCC) is an iterative multiscale algorithm for classifying LiDAR returns that exceed positive surface curvature thresholds, resulting in all the LiDAR measurements being classified as ground or nonground. The MCC algorithm yields a solution of classified returns that support bare-earth surface interpolation at a resolution commensurate with the sampling frequency of the LiDAR survey. Errors in classified ground returns were assessed using 204 independent validation points consisting of 165 field plot global positioning system locations and 39 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Geodetic Survey monuments. Jackknife validation and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assess the quality and error of a bare-earth digital elevation model interpolated from the classified returns. A local indicator of spatial association statistic was used to test for commission errors in the classified ground returns. Results demonstrate that the MCC model minimizes commission errors while retaining a high proportion of ground returns and provides high confidence in the derived ground surface},

	abstract = {© 2015, (publisher). All Rights Reserved. Wildfires play a major role in driving vegetation changes and can cause important environmental and economic losses in Mediterranean forests, especially where the dominant species lacks efficient postfire regeneration mechanisms. In these areas, postdisturbance vegetation management strategies need to be based on detailed, spatially continuous inventories of the burned area. Here, we present a methodology in which we combine airborne LiDAR and multispectral imagery to assess postfire regeneration types in a spatially continuous way, using a Mediterranean black pine (Pinus nigra Arn ssp. salzmannii) forest that burned in 1998 as a case study. Five postfire regeneration types were obtained by clustering field-plot data using Ward's method. Two of the five regeneration types presented high tree cover (one clearly dominated by hardwoods and the other dominated by pines), a third type presented low to moderate tree cover, being dominated by hardwoods, and the remaining two types matched to areas dominated by soil–herbaceous or shrub layers with very low or no tree cover (i.e., very low to no tree species regeneration). These five types of regeneration were used to conduct a supervised classification of remote sensing data using a nonparametric supervised classification technique. Compared with independent field validation points, the remote sensing based assessment method resulted in a global classification accuracy of 82.7\%. Proportions of regeneration types in the study area indicated a general shift from the former pine-dominated forest toward hardwood dominance and showed no serious problems of regeneration failure. Our methodological approach appears to be appropriate for informing postdisturbance vegetation management strategies over large areas.},

	abstract = {This paper explores spatial-temporal dynamics in fire regime features, such as fire frequency, burnt area, large fires, and natural- and human-caused fires, as an essential part of fire regime characterisation. Changes in fire features are analysed at different spatial–regional and provincial/NUTS3 levels, together with summer and winter temporal scales, using historical fire data from Spain for the period 1974\&ndash;2013. Temporal shifts in fire features are investigated by means of change point detection procedures \&ndash; Pettitt test, AMOC (At Most One Change), PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) and BinSeg (Binary Segmentation) \&ndash; at regional level to identify changes in the time series of the features. A trend analysis was conducted using the Mann\&ndash;Kendall and Sen's slope tests at both regional and NUTS3 level. Finally, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Varimax Rotation to trend outputs \&ndash; mainly Sen's slope values \&ndash; to summarize overall temporal behaviour, also to explore potential links in the evolution of fire features. Our results suggest that most fire features show remarkable shifts between the late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Mann\&ndash;Kendall outputs revealed negative trends in the Mediterranean region. Results from Sen's slope suggest high spatial and intra-annual variability across the study area. Fire activity related to human sources seems to be experiencing an overall decrease in the north-west provinces, particularly pronounced during summer. Conversely, the hinterlands and the Mediterranean coast are gradually becoming less fire-affected. Finally, PCA enabled trends to be synthesized into four main components: winter fire frequency (PC1), summer burnt area (PC2), large fires (PC3) and natural fires (PC4).},

	abstract = {Fire frequency and burn severity may increase in pine forests in the Mediterranean Basin under the warmer and drier climate projected for this region. Our study aims to evaluate the role of fire frequency and burn severity in the post-fire recruitment and development of Mediterranean serotinous pines under different environmental conditions. Two pine forests representing contrasting climatic conditions and soil types that support serotinous pines in the Iberian Peninsula and affected by large wildfires in summer 2012, were selected. In these two study sites, we determined the number of wildfires between 1978 and 2012 and the burn severity of the last fire (2012 at both sites) through the dNBR spectral index. Three and four years after the wildfires, we sampled the density, cover and height of pine seedlings and the cover of woody understory species in 1296 1 m2 plots. The results indicated that the density and cover of pine seedlings was low after two fires combined with high severities, as well as after three fires, regardless of burn severity. Seedling recruitment after three fires was particularly threatened in the most arid study site (0.01 seedlings m−2), resulting in low seedling cover (0.01\%). Seedling height decreased with fire frequency in both study sites, and with burn severity owing to fire-induced shifts in soil fertility and microclimatic conditions. There was a significant negative effect of the cover of woody understory species on the recruitment and cover of pine seedlings. Our results suggest that the effects of increasing fire frequency and severity on pine regeneration may be aggravated under arid conditions. Additionally, this study encourages forest managers to avoid the occurrence of frequent crown fires in order to prevent the loss of serotinous pine forest, and provides useful information to predict the scenarios in which post-fire restoration actions would be helpful.},

	abstract = {Extreme fire events, also referred to as " megafires," are not uncommon events on a global scale; they tend to happen a steady frequency in different parts of the world, although, at a local or regional scale, they constitute unique and severe fire episodes. Even if there is not a complete agreement on the term, megafires often refers to those fire events that cause catastrophic damages in terms of human casualties, economic losses, or both. In this article we analyze some of the most damaging fire episodes in Europe in the last decades. Our analysis relates the events to existing conditions in terms of number of fires and burnt areas in the countries and regions where they occurred, showing that these large fire episodes do not follow the general trend of those variables and constitute outstanding critical events. Megafires are characterized on the basis of the meteorological and fire danger conditions prior to the event and those under which they develop. Impact is assessed in terms of total burnt area, estimates of economic losses, if available, and number of human casualties caused by the megafire event. We analyze fire-fighting means available for the extinction of each megafire, as reported in the annual reports of the European Commission, to determine if fire spread might have been related to lack of available means for initial control and extinction. All countries where the reported megafires took place are in fire prone areas where active fire campaigns take place every year. Our results determine that megafires are critical events that stand out with respect to the average conditions in the respective countries; in all cases, the impact of the fires set a record damage in the country or region where the megafire event took place. It is shown that, in the cases under study, megafires were driven by critical weather conditions that lead to a concentration of numerous large fires in time and space (fire clusters). It is shown that these megafire events occurred independently of the large expenditures in forest fire fighting means and increased preparedness in the countries where they took place. The simultaneity in fire ignitions and the rapid fire spread prevented efficient initial fire attacks. Therefore, megafires occur independently of the available fire means in the countries and are set under control only when the weather conditions improve and facilitate fire fighting. Our analysis supports a series of recommendations that are seek to promote fire-prevention oriented forest management and increase awareness on potential extreme fire events to prevent the occurrence of megafires in Mediterranean regions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean ecosystems are adapted to recurrent forest fires by having regeneration mechanisms that overcome the immediate effects of fire. However, the increasing frequency of fires in most European Mediterranean countries is challenging the natural regrowth capability of these ecosystems. In this context, monitoring post-fire vegetation recovery is a priority for forest management and soil erosion control. In this work, a 13-year series (1999–2011) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data was used to model post-fire vegetation recovery as a function of burn severity and to quantify post-fire resilience as a measure of vegetation cover regrowth. We evaluated a large forest fire located in Spain that burned approximately 30km2 of Pinus pinaster Ait. in August 1998. 88 field plots of four burn severity levels (unburned, low, moderate and high) were measured in the field a year after the fire. As a variable representative of vegetation, we chose the shade normalized green vegetation fraction image (SGV) obtained by applying Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to the original Landsat TM/ETM+ images. The SGV values were extracted for the 88 field plots and, after performing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test allowed us to estimate resilience of vegetation cover as the number of post-fire years exhibiting a statistically significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Next, SGV values were referenced to unburned control plots values and the vegetation recovery index (VRI) was defined. The evolution in time curve of VRI for low, moderate and highly fire affected vegetation was fit using trend models (specifically, an exponential trend for VRI in high and moderate burn severity levels; a linear trend for low burn severity level, Root Mean Square Error, RMSE=0.18, 0.13, and 0.09, respectively). We observed that vegetation cover affected by low severity fire recovered to its original state after 7years, and vegetation cover affected by moderate severity recovered after 13years. Vegetation affected by high severity fire was estimated to recover after 20years. We conclude that VRI time series based on multi-temporal MESMA fractions from Landsat data can be considered a valuable indicator of the post-fire vegetation cover recovery. Its temporal evolution represented post-fire vegetation cover regrowth adequately and facilitated the estimate of vegetation cover resilience in Mediterranean forests.},

Three different restoration treatments including natural regeneration (NR), artificial regeneration (AR), and artificial promotion (AP), were adopted in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area of China after a serious fire occurred on May 6, 1987. NR is a control treatment where recovery occurs naturally without intervention, AR comprises salvage logging followed by planting, while AP includes regeneration by removing dead trees, weeding, and tidying to promote seed germination. In this study, the objective was to detect and compare the effects of the three restoration treatments using radar indices derived from ALOS/PALSAR data. Four time-series SAR images were pre-processed to acquire the backscattering coefficients. Then the coefficients in both HH and HV polarization were examined and two radar vegetation indices were derived and evaluated, based on which, the post-fire forest dynamics under different restoration treatments were detected and compared. The results showed that the forests under NR presented a completely different recovery trajectory compared to those under the other two treatments. This difference could be characterized by both the backscattering intensity in HH and HV polarization and two radar indices. This study indicated the effects of different restoration treatments, as well as demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of radar remote sensing techniques in forest monitoring and management.},

	abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) point clouds over large forested areas can be processed to segment individual trees and subsequently extract tree-level information. Existing segmentation procedures typically detect more than 90\% of overstory trees, yet they barely detect 60\% of understory trees because of the occlusion effect of higher canopy layers. Although understory trees provide limited financial value, they are an essential component of ecosystem functioning by offering habitat for numerous wildlife species and influencing stand development. Here we model the occlusion effect in terms of point density. We estimate the fractions of points representing different canopy layers (one overstory and multiple understory) and also pinpoint the required density for reasonable tree segmentation (where accuracy plateaus). We show that at a density of 170 pt/m 2 understory trees can likely be segmented as accurately as overstory trees. Given the advancements of LiDAR sensor technology, point clouds will affordably reach this required density. Using modern computational approaches for big data, the denser point clouds can efficiently be processed to ultimately allow accurate remote quantification of forest resources. The methodology can also be adopted for other similar remote sensing or advanced imaging applications such as geological subsurface modelling or biomedical tissue analysis.},

	abstract = {Forest ecosystems provide a host of services and societal benefits, including carbon storage, habitat for fauna, recreation, and provision of wood or non-wood products. In a context of complex demands on forest resources, identifying priorities for biodiversity and carbon budgets require accurate tools with sufficient temporal frequency. Moreover, understanding long term forest dynamics is necessary for sustainable planning and management. Remote sensing (RS) is a powerful means for analysis, synthesis and report, providing insights and contributing to inform decisions upon forest ecosystems. In this communication we review current applications of RS techniques in Spanish forests, examining possible trends, needs, and opportunities offered by RS in a forestry context. Currently, wall-to-wall optical and LiDAR data are extensively used for a wide range of applications—many times in combination—whilst radar or hyperspectral data are rarely used in the analysis of Spanish forests. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) carrying visible and infrared sensors are gaining ground in acquisition of data locally and at small scale, particularly for health assessments. Forest fire identification and characterization are prevalent applications at the landscape scale, whereas structural assessments are the most widespread analyses carried out at limited extents. Unparalleled opportunities are offered by the availability of diverse RS data like those provided by the European Copernicus programme and recent satellite LiDAR launches, processing capacity, and synergies with other ancillary sources to produce information of our forests. Overall, we live in times of unprecedented opportunities for monitoring forest ecosystems with a growing support from RS technologies.},

	abstract = {Discrete changes in forest abundance, distribution, and productivity are readily detectable using a number of remotely sensed data sources; however, continuous changes such as growth and succession processes are more difficult to monitor. In this research we explore the potential of spectral trajectories generated from a 35-year (1973-2008) time-series of Landsat imagery to characterize change processes in a dynamic forest environment in northwestern Alberta, Canada. We propose a method of hierarchical spatio-temporal segmentation that enables the characterization of change processes that are spatially diffuse and temporally imprecise. Calibrated imagery from Landsat sensors are radiometrically normalized and two metrics derived from the Tasseled Cap Transformation components, greenness and brightness, are used to generate the Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA). The TCA is a measure of the proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation (the occupation state), and its derivative, the Process Indicator (PI), is a measure of change in this proportion through time. These indices condense information from the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and facilitate lengthy time series analysis of forest landscape change using data from all Landsat sensors.A combination of the original TCA and its derivative sequence are input to a three level hierarchical segmentation process with the highest and lowest levels defining homogeneous objects at the initial and final date, and the intermediate level identifying trajectories with similar change processes. The development through time of the TCA and PI are described, and the spatial and temporal associations of processes are statistically assessed using the Moran's Index.A full range of change types were identified on the landscape, from stand replacing disturbances to more subtle growth and succession processes. Results indicate that the study area is in a constant state of change, and maintains a high average proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation. The amount of total landscape modified per decade increased from 18\% and 14\% in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, to more than 30\% and 33\% in the 1990s and 2000s. On average, the proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation was increasing prior to 1981, decreasing between 1981 and 1997, and increasing post-1997. There was a high degree of spatial autocorrelation amongst change processes, with a maximum Moran's I of 0.79 in 1973; landscape change became more spatially disperse and wi{\textbackslash}ldots},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the fire regime of the Mediterranean Basin has been disturbed by various factors: climate change; forest management policies; land cover; changed landscape. Size and severity have notably increased, which in turn have increased large fires events with {\textbackslash}textgreater 500 ha burned (high severity). In spite of Mediterranean ecosystems' high resilience to fire, these changes have implied more vulnerability and reduced natural recovery with irreparable long-term negative effects. Knowledge of the response of ecosystems to increasing severity, mainly in semiarid areas, is still lacking, which is needed to rehabilitate and restore burned areas. Our approach assessed the resilience concept by focusing on the recovery of ecosystem functions and services, measured as changes in the composition and diversity of plant community vegetation and structure. This will be validated in the long term as a model of ecosystem response. Also, depending on the pre-fire characteristics of vegetation, fire severity and the post-fire management, this approach will lead to tools that can be applied to implement post-fire restoration efforts in order to help decision making in planning activities. Regarding Mediterranean ecosystems' ability to recover after wildfires, this study concludes that pre-fire communities are resilient in these fire-prone areas, but the window for natural recovery in semiarid areas of Aleppo pine forest in SE Iberian Peninsula varied from 3 to 15 post-fire years. Fire severity was also key for effects on the ecosystem: the vegetation types of areas burned with low and medium severity recovered naturally, while those areas with a high-severity burn induced shrublands. We concluded that very strong regeneration activity exists in the short term, and that the negative effects of medium- and high-severity fire are evidenced in the mid and long term, which affect natural recovery. Adaptive forest management to rehabilitate and restore burned Mediterranean ecosystems should be implemented.},

Here, we introduce LT for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE platform simplifies pre-processing steps, allowing focus on the translation of the core temporal segmentation algorithm. Temporal segmentation involved a series of repeated random access calls to each pixel's time series, resulting in a set of breakpoints ("vertices") that bound straight-line segments. The translation of the algorithm into GEE included both transliteration and code analysis, resulting in improvement and logic error fixes. At six study areas representing diverse land cover types across the U.S., we conducted a direct comparison of the new LT-GEE code against the heritage code (LT-IDL). The algorithms agreed in most cases, and where disagreements occurred, they were largely attributable to logic error fixes in the code translation process. The practical impact of these changes is minimal, as shown by an example of forest disturbance mapping. We conclude that the LT-GEE algorithm represents a faithful translation of the LT code into a platform easily accessible by the broader user community.},

	abstract = {We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes.

We modeled live, aboveground tree biomass using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data and applied the models to 20+ year time-series of Landsat satellite imagery to derive trajectories of aboveground forest biomass for study locations in Arizona and Minnesota. We compared three statistical techniques (Reduced Major Axis regression, Gradient Nearest Neighbor imputation, and Random Forests regression trees) for modeling biomass to better understand how the choice of model type affected predictions of biomass dynamics. Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat FIA inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames. The application of these techniques to a large sample of Landsat scenes across North America will facilitate spatial and temporal estimation of biomass dynamics associated with forest disturbance and regrowth, and aid in national-level estimates of biomass change in support of the North American Carbon Program. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

In such places, farmland abandonment represents a significant land use change from cropping to a complex of plant successions. The present study assesses the hydromorphological effects of land abandonment in Europe, and the consequences thereof with respect to water resource availability and soil erosion. The evolution of abandoned fields depends on (i) the time of abandonment; (ii) climatic conditions in the abandoned area; (iii) particular characteristics of the fields; (iv) the land management regimen following abandonment; and, (v) the role played by government policy. Throughout most of Europe, vegetation on abandoned farmland has evolved into dense forest or shrub. The expansion of vegetation explains, in part, the perceived decline in water resources, reductions in soil loss and sediment delivery, and the progressive improvement of soil characteristics. Such evolution has resulted in changing stream morphology, featuring narrowing and incision, and a decline in sedimentation level in Mediterranean reservoirs. The abandonment of bench terrace fields coincided with an increase in the occurrence of small landslides in the steps between terraces, as well as changes in the spatial organization of saturated areas. Plant colonization is slower in semiarid areas, increasing the development of soil crusts that reduce infiltration and increase overland flow. Land policies with detailed capability are necessary to remediate the consequences of farmland abandonment in various European environments. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is expanding and intensifying in many areas of the world, but abandoned agriculture is also becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe (∼1,236,000km 2) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, ∼250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65\%. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1\% of the total area, compared to 29.6\% agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8\% producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003-2008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8\% over the use of NDVI data alone. The approach that we identified here is promising and suggests that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales, which is relevant to gain a better understanding of this important land use change process. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

This study analyzed the capabilities of Landsat ETM+ remote sensing data combined with existing ecological land unit classifications to discriminate and quantify patterns of succession at the landscape scale over the 4200 ha University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in northern Lower Michigan. In a hierarchical approach first multi-temporal Landsat ETM+ was used with a landscape ecosystem classification to map upland forest cover types (overall accuracy 91.7\%). Next the aspen cover type was subset and successional pathways were mapped within that type (overall accuracy 89.8\%). Results demonstrated that Landsat ETM+ may be useful for these purposes; stratification of upland from wetland types using an ecological land unit classification eliminated confounding issues; multi-temporal methods discriminated evergreen conifer versus deciduous understories. The Landsat ETM+ classifications were then used to quantify succession and its relationship to landform-level ecological land units. Forests on moraine and ice contact landforms are succeeding distinctly to northern hardwoods (95\% and 88\% respectively); those on outwash and other landforms show greater diversity of successional pathways. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, illegal logging increased and reforestation on abandoned farmland was widespread after the breakdown of socialism, and the region's forest cover trends remain overall largely unclear. Our goal here was to map forest cover change and to assess the extent of illegal logging and reforestation in the Ukrainian Carpathians. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive forest change trajectories between 1988 and 2007 for the entire Ukrainian Carpathians. We calculated logging and reforestation rates, and compared Landsat-based forest trends to official statistics and inventory maps. Our classification resulted in reliable forest/non-forest maps (overall accuracies between 97.1\%-98.01\%) and high clear cut detection rates (on average 89.4\%). Forest cover change was widespread in the Ukrainian Carpathians between 1988 and 2007. We found forest cover increase in peripheral areas, forest loss in the interior Carpathians, and increased logging in remote areas. Overall, our results suggest that unsustainable forest use from socialist times likely persisted in the post-socialist period, resulting in a continued loss of older forests and forest fragmentation. Landsat-based forest trends differed substantially from official forest resource statistics. Illegal logging appears to have been at least as extensive as documented logging during the early 1990s and so-called sanitary clear-cuts represent a major loophole for overharvesting and logging in restricted areas. Reforestation and illegal logging are frequently not accounted for in forest resource statistics, highlighting limitations of these data. Combating illegal logging and transitioning towards sustainable forestry requires better monitoring and up-to-date accounting of forest resources, in the Carpathians and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and remote sensing can be a key technology to achieve these goals. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Successional theory lacks an explicit, conceptual integration across types of disturbances and biomes. Most successional research addresses site- or process-specific questions, but extrapolation of the findings to broad scales is limited. Studies of plant succession are often distinguished by the severity of the disturbance that triggers them (severely disturbed: primary; less severely disturbed: secondary). Here, we examine the common assumption that primary and secondary succession differ. We use two anthropogenic disturbances for this comparison, mining and ploughing. Successional generalizations are confounded by a complexity of environmental factors including climatic and geographic variation. We address these issues by contrasting succession across multiple biomes. We selected 166 studies of succession on mining sites (n = 73) or abandoned fields (n = 93) that allowed us to compare successional trajectories in terms of the likelihood of a return to target vegetation, changes in species richness, type of trajectories, and the importance of alien species. Success of both types of succession (a return to target vegetation) differed significantly among biomes, with more likely success in cold than warm biomes (for both primary and secondary seres) and in humid than arid biomes (primary seres only). Primary seres were also more likely than secondary seres to have increases in species richness, a predominance of divergent trajectories, and a lower likelihood that alien species influenced succession. Synthesis. The probability of reaching target vegetation by spontaneous succession is generally greater in biomes at higher versus lower latitudes. Primary and secondary seres differed regarding species richness, trajectories, and the role of alien species. Our results highlight that broad generalizations about succession are possible, despite a paucity of comparable data and our use of only two types of anthropogenic disturbances. Any generalizations that might be found among seres across disturbances and biomes will provide a practical framework for land managers to guide restoration efforts, particularly in poorly studied areas.},

Little is known about the carbon stocks of such peculiar ecosystems compared with different stages of secondary succession. We investigated the carbon variation in aboveground woody biomass, in litter and soil, and the nitrogen variation in litter and soil, in a 100 years long secondary succession in Mediterranean ecosystems. A vineyard, three stages of plant succession (high maquis, maquisforest, and forest-maquis), and an old growth forest were compared. Soil samples at two soil depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm), and two litter types, relatively undecomposed and partly decomposed, were collected. Carbon stock in aboveground woody biomass increased from 6 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to 105 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. Along the secondary succession, soil carbon considerably increased from about 33 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to about 69 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. Soil nitrogen has more than doubled, ranging from 4.1 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to 8.8 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. Both soil parameters were found to be affected by successional stage and soil depth but not by their interaction. While the C/N ratio in the soil remained relatively constant during the succession, the C/N ratio of the litter strongly decreased, probably following the progressive increase in the holm oak contribution. While carbon content in litter decreased along the succession, nitrogen content slightly increased. Overall, carbon stock in aboveground woody biomass, litter and soil increased from about 48 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to about 198 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. The results of this study indicate that, even in Mediterranean environments, considerable amounts of carbon may be stored through secondary succession processes up to old growth forest.},

	abstract = {1. Many studies in northern Europe, North and South America, describe regional trends of population densification at altitudinal and polar tree lines during the 20th century. The purpose of this study was (1) to ascertain if this regeneration enhancement is present across the alpine ecotones of the Pyrenees, (2) if synchronous recruitment trends are common among the studied populations and (3) to determine the tree limit stability during recent decades. 2. Twelve Pinus uncinata tree line populations were studied on the Iberian eastern range of the Pyrenees. Rectangular plots ranging from 940 to 7600 m2 were set along the forest-alpine grassland transition; more than 3600 P. uncinata individuals were mapped. Tree size and age were used to establish the demographic structure at each stand, and to characterize abrupt or smooth transition patterns along the tree line ecotone. A new procedure for estimating missing rings in off-centre cores was developed to ensure a correct interval for the age-classes distribution analysis. 3. Past and recent synchronous recruitment trends (mid 19th century, second half of the 20th century) were apparent at the tree line over the studied area of the Pyrenean range. The ecotone densification since the 1950s occurred in the context of climatic warming and substantial land use abandonment. Both gradual and step-like transition patterns in tree age and size along the ecotone were observed. 4. Regeneration enhancement in the last approximately 30 years appears as an abrupt change in population age structures, which could indicate the importance of feedback mechanisms for tree line recruitment dynamics. In 50\% of the surveyed tree lines ecotone densification has been coupled to tree limit shifts in the recent past. This indicates both great tree limit sensitivity to short-term climatic changes and the presence of differential tree line dynamics at a regional scale. 5. Synthesis. The observed past and recent synchronous recruitment trends suggest the presence of regional climatic factors modulating tree line structure and dynamics. However, tree line dynamics in the Pyrenees have been widely affected by local anthropogenic activities. We suggest that the presence of step-like tree line transitions in tree age can be considered an evidence of recent human-induced disturbances when no other major natural disturbances affect the tree line dynamics. © 2008 The Authors.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTInterest in knowing more about the Earth’s land cover and how it has changed over time motivated the mission and sensor design of early terrestrial remote sensing systems. Rapid developments in computer hardware and software in the last four decades have greatly increased the capacity for satellite data acquisition, downlink, dissemination, and end user science and applications. In 1992, Townshend reviewed the state of land cover mapping using Earth observation data at a pivotal point in time and in the context of years of research and practical experience with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Visible (HRV) and Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, demonstrating the opportunities and information content possible with increased spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Townshend characterized the state-of-the-art for land cover at that time, identified trends, and shared insights on research directions. Now, on the 25th anniversary of Townshend’s important work, given numerous advances and emerging trends, we revisit the status of land cover mapping with Earth observation data. We posit that a new era of land cover analysis – Land Cover 2.0 – has emerged, enabled by free and open access data, analysis ready data, high performance computing, and rapidly developing data processing and analysis capabilities. Herein we characterize this new era in land cover information, highlighting institutional, computational, as well as theoretical developments that have occurred over the past 25 years, identifying the key issues and opportunities that have emerged. We conclude that Land Cover 2.0 offers efficiencies in information generation that will result in a proliferation of land cover products, reinforcing the need for transparency regarding the input data and algorithms used as well as adoption, implementation, and communication of rigorous accuracy assessment protocols. Further, land cover and land change assessments are no longer independent activities. Knowledge of land change is available to inform and enrich land cover generation.},

Location: More than 1000 linear kilometres of sub-alpine tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain) Methods: Using aerial photographs and supervised classification, we reclassified the images into a binary raster with 'tree' and 'non-tree' values, and determined canopy cover in 1956 and 2006. We then determined the change in position of the tree line between 1956 and 2006 based on changes in forest cover. We used the distance from the position of the tree line in 1956 to the theoretical potential tree line - determined from interpretation of aerial photographs, identifying the highest old remnants of forest for homogeneous areas of the landscape in terms of bioclimatic conditions, bedrock, landform and exposure - as a surrogate of intensity of past land uses. Results: Our analyses showed that the Pyrenean tree line has moved upwards on average almost 40m (mean advance±SE: 35.3±0.5m, P{\textbackslash}textless0.001), although in most cases it has remained unchanged (61.8\%) or advanced moderately, i.e. between 25 and 100m (23.7\%); only 9.2\% of the locations have advanced more than 100m. Upward shifts of the tree line were significantly larger in locations heavily modified in the past by anthropogenic disturbance (mean advance 50.8±1.1m) compared with near natural tree line locations (19.7±0.8m, P{\textbackslash}textless0.001), where the mean displacement was much lower than expected and was not related to changes in temperature along the study period. Main conclusions: Our results stress the impact of the cessation of human activity in driving forest dynamics at the tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees, and reveal a very low or even negligible signal of climate change in the study area.},

	abstract = {Aim To assess the spatial patterns of forest expansion (encroachment and densification) for mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Ram.) during the last 50 years at a whole mountain range scale by the study of different topographic and socio-economic potential drivers in the current context of global change. Location The study area includes the whole distributional area of mountain pine in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain). This represents more than 80 municipalities, covering a total area of 6018 km2. Methods Forest cover was obtained by image reclassification of more than 200 pairs of aerial photographs taken in 1956 and 2006. Encroachment and densification were determined according to changes in forest cover, and were expressed as binary variables on a 150 × 150 m cell-size grid. We then used logistic regression to analyse the effects of several topographic and socio-economic variables on forest expansion. Results In the period analysed, mountain pine increased its surface coverage by 8898 ha (an increase of more than 16\%). Mean canopy cover rose from 31.0\% in 1956 to 55.6\% in 2006. Most of the expansion was found on north-facing slopes and at low altitudes. Socio-economic factors arose as major factors in mountain pine expansion, as encroachment rates were higher in municipalities with greater population losses or weaker primary sector development. Main conclusions The spatial patterns of mountain pine expansion showed a good match with the main patterns of land-use change in the Pyrenees, suggesting that land-use changes have played a more important role than climate in driving forest dynamics at a landscape scale over the period studied. Further studies on forest expansion at a regional scale should incorporate patterns of land-use changes to correctly interpret drivers of forest encroachment and densification.},

	abstract = {Abstract Questions: Did the forest area in the Swiss Alps increase between 1985 and 1997? Does the forest expansion near the tree line represent an invasion into abandoned grasslands (ingrowth) or a true upward shift of the local tree line? What land cover / land use classes did primarily regenerate to forest, and what forest structural types did primarily regenerate? And, what are possible drivers of forest regeneration in the tree line ecotone, climate and/or land use change? Location: Swiss Alps. Methods: Forest expansion was quantified using data from the repeated Swiss land use statistics GEOSTAT. A moving window algorithm was developed to distinguish between forest ingrowth and upward shift. To test a possible climate change influence, the resulting upward shifts were compared to a potential regional tree line. Results: A significant increase of forest cover was found between 1650 m and 2450 m. Above 1650 m, 10\% of the new forest areas were identified as true upward shifts whereas 90\% represented ingrowth, and we identified both land use and climate change as likely drivers. Most upward shift activities were found to occur within a band of 300 m below the potential regional tree line, indicating land use as the most likely driver. Only 4\% of the upward shifts were identified to rise above the potential regional tree line, thus indicating climate change. Conclusions: Land abandonment was the most dominant driver for the establishment of new forest areas, even at the tree line ecotone. However, a small fraction of upwards shift can be attributed to the recent climate warming, a fraction that is likely to increase further if climate continues to warm, and with a longer time-span between warming and measurement of forest cover.},

	abstract = {In southern Europe, climate trends are expected to be characterized by an increase in temperatures and less water availability. Analyzing the role of structural factors and the influence of a changing climate provides insights into the evolution of forest ecosystems in regions with similar environmental conditions. The Mediterranean fringe of the Iberian Peninsula is of particular interest due to its diverse topo climatic conditions and the increase in drought episodes during the last decades. This work studies forest dynamics in large areas of this geographical region by analyzing nine forest transitions. Vegetation covers were classified from three Landsat scenes for the period 1987–2012, and sub-periods 1987–2002 and 2002–2012. Conditions were described by topography derived variables, human factors and drought-occurrence variables. Boosted regression trees were used to identify the most important variables and describe the relationships between the forest dynamics and key factors. Variables such as solar radiation, topographic wetness index and tolerance to drought have been shown to be key factors in forest succession and when comparisons are made between vegetation groups. Main findings: The transition rate to Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean broadleaf forests has increased during the analyzed period, while the transition rate to coniferous forests has decreased; Transitions to Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean broadleaf forests are positively associated with drought occurrence while transitions to conifers are negatively affected by drought; Transitions from shrublands to forest stages are more vulnerable to factors controlling water availability; Important interactions between topography derived variables and drought have been found. The study provides robust evidence that drought occurrence plays an important role in the decline of conifers and the expansion of broadleaves, which could become the dominant species in many areas of the Mediterranean if climate model forecasts are met.},

Son el resultado de una serie de iniciativas, generalmente colectivas, que dan lugar a la superposición de diferentes elementos que corresponden a distintos momentos históricos. En ambientes de montaña los factores más influyentes en la construcción de paisajes culturales son el escalonamiento altitudinal de los pisos geoecológicos, la diversidad topográfica y topoclimática, el crecimiento demográfico, los acontecimientos históricos (incluyendo la superposición de culturas) y la influencia de los mercados. El éxito de las sociedades montanas dependió de su conocimiento del medio y, especialmente, de la importancia de la gravedad en un ambiente de alta energía, con el fin de controlar la escorrentía y la erosión del suelo. Por eso, las áreas de montaña necesitan una organización social y territorial compleja, para hacer frente a la adversidad provocada por la rudeza del clima y la explotación de laderas pendientes. Naturalmente, este esfuerzo implica un gran gasto de energía en la conservación del paisaje, que puede desmoronarse de manera irreversible por muchas razones, entre ellas la despoblación y el abandono de tierras de cultivo, que conducen a lo que podemos llamar una deconstrucción del paisaje. Esta última representa la pérdida de un patrimonio cultural que, estudiado a fondo, nos enseña mucho acerca de la forma óptima de aprovechar los recursos naturales y también de los errores que se han cometido en el pasado. A pesar de los cambios recientes, quedan aún muchos restos de los paisajes culturales pirenaicos: campos cercados que representan una creciente individualización en la gestión del territorio, laderas aterrazadas, panares en el límite superior del piso montano, y los extensos pastos subalpinos, que representan la eliminación de un espacio forestal para favorecer los movimientos trashumantes.},

In addition, species richness and diversity change as herbaceous species are replaced by woody species. This is not a new phenomenon, but has been going on continually as the climate of the Planet has changed. However, in the past 160 years the changes have been unparalleled. The process is encroachment not invasion because woody species that have been increasing in density are native species and have been present in these communities for thousands of years. These indigenous or native woody species have increased in density, cover and biomass because of changes in one or more abiotic or biotic factors or conditions. Woody species that have increased in density and cover are not the cause of the encroachment, but the result of changes of other factors. Globally, the orbit of the Earth is becoming more circular and less elliptical, causing moderation of the climate. Additional global climate changing factors including elevated levels of CO2 and parallel increases in temperature are background factors and probably not the principal causes directing the current wave of encroachment. There is probably not a single reason for encroachment, but a combination of factors that are difficult to disentangle. The prime cause of the current and recent encroachment appears to be high and constant levels of grass herbivory by domestic animals. This herbivory reduces fine fuel with a concomitant reduction in fire frequency or in some cases a complete elimination of fire from these communities. Conditions would now favor the woody plants over the grasses. Reduced grass competition, woody plant seed dispersal and changes in animal populations seem to modify the rate of encroachment rather than being the cause. High concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not required to explain current woody plant encroachment. Changes in these grassland communities will continue into the future but the specifics are difficult to predict. Density, cover and species composition will fluctuate and will probably continue to change. Increased levels of anthropogenic soil nitrogen suggest replacement of many legumes by other woody species. Modification and perhaps reversal of the changes in these former grassland communities will be an arduous, continuing and perhaps impossible management task.},

	abstract = {Abstract We used a set of six regional climate models (RCMs) from PRUDENCE project to analyse the uncertainties and direction and magnitude of the expected changes on precipitation and temperature (B2 and A2 scenarios) for the end of the 21st century in the Pyrenees, south of Europe. There have been few studies of climate change effects on this mountain range, though there can be noticeable impacts on the economy and ecology of the region and the surrounding lowlands. The analysis of the accuracy of the RCMs and the impacts of climate change over the region are addressed considering the mean values for the whole region, their spatial distribution patterns and the inter-model variability. Previously, the creation of distributed layers of temperature and precipitation from data provided by weather observatories was necessary to assess the ability of RCMs to reproduce the observed climate. Results show that mean biases between observed climate and control runs (1960–1990) are around 20\% for precipitation and 1 °C for temperature. At annual basis, a mean decrease of 10.7 and 14.8\% in precipitation, and an increase of 2.8 and 4 °C is expected in the next century in the area for A2 and B2 scenarios respectively. Effects of climate change will be more pronounced in the southern slopes of the range (Spanish Pyrenees), and lower in the coastland areas. Moreover, results on accuracy and expected changes are subject to a large spatial and seasonal variability as well, as the six RCMs present noticeable differences on accuracy and sensitivity to climate change forcings.

	abstract = {AbstractThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is challenging the world. With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90\% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30\% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism. It discusses why COVID-19 is an analogue to the ongoing climate crisis, and why there is a need to question the volume growth tourism model advocated by UNWTO, ICAO, CLIA, WTTC and other tourism organizations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Despite escalating expenditures in firefighting, extreme fire events continue to pose a major threat to ecosystem services and human communities in Mediterranean areas. Developing a safe and effective fire response is paramount to efficiently restrict fire spread, reduce negative effects to natural values, prevent residential housing losses, and avoid causalties. Though current fire policies in most countries demand full suppression, few studies have attempted to identify the strategic locations where firefighting efforts would likely contain catastrophic fire events. The success in containing those fires that escape initial attack is determined by diverse structural factors such as ground accessibility, airborne support, barriers to surface fire spread, and vegetation impedance. In this study, we predicted the success in fire containment across Catalonia (northeastern Spain) using a model generated with random forest from detailed geospatial data and a set of 73 fire perimeters for the period 2008–2016. The model attained a high predictive performance (AUC = 0.88), and the results were provided at fine resolution (25 m) for the entire study area (32,108 km2). The highest success rates were found in agricultural plains along the nonburnable barriers such as major road corridors and largest rivers. Low levels of containment likelihood were predicted for dense forest lands and steep-relief mountainous areas. The results can assist in suppression resource pre-positioning and extended attack decision making, but also in strategic fuels management oriented at creating defensive locations and fragmenting the landscape in operational firefighting areas. Our modeling workflow and methods may serve as a baseline to generate locally adapted models in fire-prone areas elsewhere.},

The variables considered in this study can be grouped into environmental, socio-economic, and those related to farming practices. Bearing in mind the potentially large number of variables, a few questions had to be answered at the outset: (1) which of the variables are really driving factors in the abandonment process of farming plots?; (2) how important is each of these variables by itself and in combination with others?; and (3) is it possible to consider all variables in the same analysis? We demonstrate the capability of data mining techniques to select the most important features for creating useful scenarios. Finally, two experiments demonstrate that the applied KDD method can be useful for selecting the best variable combinations in studies on farmland abandonment.},

	abstract = {An understanding of land use change and its drivers in semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystems is important for informing ways to facilitate adaptation to future environmental and socioeconomic pressures. In this paper, we mapped and quantified land use changes in the semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystem of Torrealvilla catchment between 1956 and 2008. Subsequently, we detected signs of landscape fragmentation and examined the relationship between land use change trajectories and a set of biophysical factors using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Finally, we qualitatively evaluated the role of socioeconomic drivers on the land use change trajectories. The study provides accounts of multidirectional land use trajectories in semi-arid Mediterranean landscapes. Our analysis shows that more than 72\% of the study area has undergone significant changes over the past five decades with pronounced effects on landscape composition and structure. Both biophysical and socioeconomic factors are strongly related to the observed spatial and temporal changes in land use. Three major trajectories were observed. Firstly, rain-fed agriculture is becoming less dominant; future abandonment of rain-fed agriculture should be anticipated. Secondly, expansion of forested areas is evident in higher altitudes. The trend is still likely to continue given the possibility of further abandonment of rain-fed farming and existing subsidies for reforestation of arable land. Thirdly, intensification has been observed which has occurred mainly in lower parts of the landscape on flat to gentle slopes and near main roads. Further intensification is likely to be subject to market drivers, irrigation water availability, and future rural development and agricultural policy. Overall, the study shows that even within a given locality, contrasting land use trajectories can emerge as a result of local responses to multiple drivers of change and these need to be carefully taken into account in future policy development.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a range of future, spatially explicit, land use change scenarios for the EU15, Norway and Switzerland based on an interpretation of the global storylines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that are presented in the special report on emissions scenarios (SRES). The methodology is based on a qualitative interpretation of the SRES storylines for the European region, an estimation of the aggregate totals of land use change using various land use change models and the allocation of these aggregate quantities in space using spatially explicit rules. The spatial patterns are further downscaled from a resolution of 10min to 250m using statistical downscaling procedures. The scenarios include the major land use/land cover classes urban, cropland, grassland and forest land as well as introducing new land use classes such as bioenergy crops. The scenario changes are most striking for the agricultural land uses, with large area declines resulting from assumptions about future crop yield development with respect to changes in the demand for agricultural commodities. Abandoned agricultural land is a consequence of these assumptions. Increases in urban areas (arising from population and economic change) are similar for each scenario, but the spatial patterns are very different. This reflects alternative assumptions about urban development processes. Forest land areas increase in all scenarios, although such changes will occur slowly and largely reflect assumed policy objectives. The scenarios also consider changes in protected areas (for conservation or recreation goals) and how these might provide a break on future land use change. The approach to estimate new protected areas is based in part on the use of models of species distribution and richness. All scenarios assume some increases in the area of bioenergy crops with some scenarios assuming a major development of this new land use. Several technical and conceptual difficulties in developing future land use change scenarios are discussed. These include the problems of the subjective nature of qualitative interpretations, the land use change models used in scenario development, the problem of validating future change scenarios, the quality of the observed baseline, and statistical downscaling techniques.},

	abstract = {Research studies aimed at integrating socio-economic and geo-bio-physical factors are increasingly being used in order to improve our understanding of the causes and effects of land-use change and to support sustainable landscape development. In line with such approaches, the study reported in this paper addresses land-use change and its drivers in the peripheral area of the Pyrenees National Park (PNP), France. The focus is land-use change on private farmland currently utilised by the farmers. The method relies on a Geographic Information System (GIS), including a digital terrain model, a digital cadastre map and a farm survey addressing current and past land use. For every parcel of land, data on current land-use practices and land-use histories since 1950 were collected during interviews with the farmers. An increase in land-use intensity occurred on some of the parcels in the late 1980s and 1990s, in contrast with the global processes of abandonment or extensification since the early 1960s. This intensification process appears to be related not only to the application of agri-environmental policies but also to specific local factors, in particular to the building of an access road to the highest part of the village. The respective roles of bio-physical factors (slope and elevation) and farm socio-economic factors (farmland spatial pattern, land-tenure system) on land-use change at parcel level have also been investigated. The impact of slope and elevation on land-use type appears overall to have been greater in 2003 than in 1950. However, these factors impact differently according to the types of landscape unit: they are not determining factors in the units remote from the village, but they do have an important role in the units close to the village. The distances of the parcels from the farmstead and their access facilities appear to be the two major farm-related factors in the local context. These results confirm the important role of land-management units’ spatial arrangement in land-use dynamics and landscape change, as has already been found in other regions. They are seen as a valuable addition to studies aimed at supporting sustainable management of traditional mountain landscapes for multifunctional purposes.},

	abstract = {Due to the high sensitivity of mountain landscapes to environmental changes, the study of land cover dynamics has become an essential tool for guiding management policies. Since the second half of the twentieth century, the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain) have been substantially altered by the loss of traditional management practices and, more recently, by the new environmental schemes developed by the Regional Government. This area is a biodiversity hotspot, representing the south-western-most distribution limit for a large number of species in Europe. Therefore, small changes in landscape patterns can result in biodiversity losses. In this study, we analyzed land cover changes in the Cantabrian Mountains from 1991 to 2004 by means of remote sensing techniques, identifying the main driving forces and classifying the territory according to its risk of land cover change. Forest expansion and loss of shrublands were the two major trajectories of change apparent during this period. When modeling the occurrence of these land cover changes, we found that performance of models was related to the nature of the change. The most accurate models were associated with processes of secondary succession, i.e. forest expansion (78.6\%), while the least accurate models related to changes linked with management decisions, i.e. loss of shrubs (61.8\%). The main drivers of change were variations in the number of goats (for the forest expansion model) and changes in the number of head of sheep and cattle (for the loss of shrubs model). Topographic conditions (altitude and slope) were relevant in both models. Our approach proposes an explicit decision support tool for landscape managers, allowing better identification of the areas where they should focus their attention.},

The method used was based on evolutionary mapping of the plant cover, application of landscape indices and spatial analysis of livestock pressure. Throughout the century the stocking rate in the valley has decreased dramatically and sheep have been replaced by cattle. Most crop areas have been abandoned, and these areas have gone through a revegetation process (involving both natural vegetation and forest plantation). Nowadays the forest is the most abundant element. The study shows that both agricultural set-aside and the stocking rate decrease have led to a more natural landscape. Finally, the positive and negative effects of extensification and the changes in vegetation patterns associated with it are debated.},

	abstract = {Traditional landscapes are changing with increasing speed and an important cultural heritage is becoming lost. New landscapes replace the traditional ones gradually or sometimes abruptly. This article analyzes the characteristics and mechanisms of landscape changes at a settlement level, by using case studies in the countryside of southern France where landscapes are in transition between new residential urbanization and land abandonment. Structural changes in land use, building and field patterns between two time periods are studied using aerial photographs covering a period from 1960 to 1999. The photographs were scanned to allow on screen digitalization and interpretation of selected features and details, which were consecutively mapped and analyzed in a GIS. Changes observed on the aerial photographs were compared with the population statistic and the accessibility of the place. All cases show very different and unique trajectories of change with complex interactions between different driving forces. Agricultural intensification and land abandonment act simultaneously with different forms of urbanization in the countryside. Although easily recognizable on the aerial photographs, a quantitative assessment of the changes in the different structural components remains difficult and the results can hardly be related to changes in population characteristics and accessibility. Consequently, structural and morphological changes observed on the aerial photographs lead to other interpretations of the underlying functional processes than the statistical data do.},

Regional differences are disappearing due to the dominating equalising impact of the worldwide market. If regional differences are not maintained and protected then the cultural landscapes of Europe and their biological diversity will decline and only remnants will remain. Models on agricultural management and data on landscape changes from all Europe confirm this. Regional differences have to be maintained through conscious environmental and ecological planning. Concepts for this have been developed in all countries in Europe, such as the ecostabilisation concept and the concept of ecological networks. Nature management by farmers is more and more accepted. Landscape planners should be aware of their changing role from designer towards negotiator with the actors in the landscape with different landscape functions and planning tasks in mind.},

	abstract = {In this study, we aimed to document the changes in the bocage and semi-openfield landscapes of Northern Galicia from the second half of the 20th century and analyse the factors driving landscape changes. In particular, we examined (1) the dynamics of the field systems characteristics in these landscapes and (2) the interrelations with changes in dominant land cover, population and farming systems (in terms of productive structure, land use system and farming practices) dynamics. The picture of the1950s showed mainly semi-openfield field systems and nucleated villages that extended through valleys in the lowland, with banks in rough coastline sectors. In the highlands we found enclosed fields and scattered hamlets interspersed within large extensions of scrubland. In between both systems, a transitional area with mixed characteristics appeared. In 2000, the transitional area expanded from the former semi-openfields and banks areas, while the highlands still retain the enclosed character. The dominant land cover has experienced significant changes throughout the area, following an increase in woodland. A reorientation of the farming system was observed, a shift in which cropland lost importance with regard to grassland, the use of scrubland became marginal and forestry increased. The decrease in the number of farms and livestock shows decline in agricultural activity. This can be closely related to changes in dominant land cover and cropping patterns. Despite recent changes, this area still retains characteristic features of traditional landscapes such as the spatial pattern of field systems and ancestral cultural practices (e.g. extensive grazing of the scrubland).},

	abstract = {In many European mountain regions, agricultural land abandonment and the related consequences for the environment are issues of increasing concern. During the last few decades, natural forest re-growth has steadily replaced agricultural land in the Swiss mountains. This is a region where forms of traditional cultivation have preserved unique landscapes and habitats of high ecological value. The aim of this study was to investigate the recent regional-scale pattern of agricultural land abandonment, as indicated by forest re-growth, in the Swiss mountains. For this, we developed multivariate spatial statistical models on the basis of mountain-wide land-use change data, evaluated between the 1980s and 1990s, and selected geo-physical and socio-economic variables. Results show that regions with shallow soils, steep slopes and under-developed road infrastructure were favoured in terms of land abandonment and forest re-growth. These regions were also characterised by low proportions of full-time farms. In some regions, strong labour markets were related to higher abandonment rates, but this is not a general trend in Swiss mountainous regions. We found no relationship between land abandonment and migration, which contrasts with ﬁndings in other European mountain regions. One model suggests a spatial ‘spillover’ effect, causing similar abandonment rates in adjacent regions, although this could not be proven in this study. We conclude that decision-makers should consider non-linearity in the pattern of land abandonment and the fact that part-time farming is related to land abandonment when designing measures to react to land abandonment and its consequences.},

Here, we build upon this experience and present the results of a global statistical analysis and a predictive model for low temperature treeline positions. We identified 376 natural treelines from satellite images across the globe, and searched for their closest climatic proxies using a climate database. The analysis included a snow and a water balance submodel to account for season length constraints by snow pack and drought. We arrive at thermal treeline criteria almost identical to those that emerged from the earlier in situ measurements: tree growth requires a minimum length of the growing season of 94 days. The model yields best fit when the season is defined as all days with a daily mean temperature {\textgreater}0.9 °C, and a mean of 6.4 °C across all these days. The resultant treeline model ‘TREELIM’ offers a robust estimation of potential treeline elevation based on climate data only. Error terms include imprecise treeline position in satellite images and climate approximations in mountainous terrain. The algorithm permits constraining low temperature limits of forest growth worldwide (including polar treelines) and also permits a bioclimatic stratification of mountain biota, for instance, for biodiversity assessments. As a side product, the model yields the global potentially forested area. The results support the isotherm theory for natural treeline formation. This completely independent statistical assessment of the climatic drivers of the global treeline phenomenon confirmed the results of a multi-year measurement campaign.},

While most studies focused on the assessment of aesthetic values under current conditions, this study aimed to evaluate the historic development of aesthetic values from the perspective of today by analysing changes in the actual supply of this CES along roads and paths in Sölden in the Ötztal valley (Austria) since the beginning of tourism. We first mapped roads and paths for five time steps over the last 150 years to then estimate aesthetic values along these infrastructures, using a spatially explicit modelling approach. Furthermore, we compared spatial patterns of visitation preferences derived from social media data with predicted aesthetic values. Our results indicate that an increased access to areas of high aesthetic values was related to general increases in the supply of aesthetic values until 1950. Although the accessibility to high-elevation areas continued to increase until 2017, aesthetic values generally decreased due to landscape changes induced by the shift from mainly agricultural to touristic use. The abandonment of alpine pastures occurred mainly above the forest belt, which coincides with high levels of photo density, as most pictures were taken around mountain huts and on mountain peaks. If carefully planned and managed, mountain regions may actively enhance aesthetic experiences and foster the touristic use by providing good infrastructure, but land use policies and landscape management should support agricultural activities to maintain high levels of aesthetic values.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the potential impact of agricultural and trade policy reform on land-use across the EU focussing particularly on the issue of land abandonment. Using a novel combined application of the well established CAPRI and Dyna-CLUE models it estimates the extent of change across Europe under removal of Pillar 1 support payments and trade liberalisation. Overall, it is estimated that around 8 per cent less land will be farmed under these reforms than under the baseline situation. However, some regions, areas and farm types face more signiﬁcant reductions. The reforms are particularly felt on livestock grazing farms situated in the more marginal areas of Europe, which also coincide with areas of high nature value. Therefore, farmland biodiversity is likely to be reduced in these areas. However, using a range of environmental indicators, relating to nutrient surpluses, GHG emissions, soil erosion and species abundance, an overall improvement in the environmental footprint of agriculture is likely. In addition, the economic efﬁciency of the agricultural sector will probably improve. The paper considers several possible options available to deal with any negative aspects of land abandonment. Following the FAO (2006), it is argued that untargeted, rather general agricultural policy measures which maintain land in production are likely to be an ineffective and inefﬁcient way to address the perceived negative consequences of abandonment. A more holistic approach to rural development is required, tailored to the speciﬁc context within each area.},

The municipalities with the greatest tourist development experienced the biggest drop in livestock farming (abandonment of cultivated land, decrease in livestock population and farms) because of the competition of tourism for labor and fertile land, which are essential to the maintenance of extensive livestock farming. Low use of pasture resources leads to their progressive loss, owing to the advance of plant succession (substitution of pastures by shrubs), decreasing landscape diversity, and increased fire hazard and soil erosion.

Our study aims to analyse the effects of shrub clearings on forest fires in La Rioja and to compare the main results with those observed in Spain in the last 30 years. We apply an interdisciplinary methodology based on the analysis of the evolution of cleared areas, the evolution of wildfires in La Rioja and Spain, mapping land use and land cover changes, and quantifying the combustibility. Results obtained in La Rioja are very positive compared with the evolution of Spain, both in the reduction of the number of fires and the burned areas. Decreases in the combustible material, fuel load and biomass and in the occurrence of fires ({\textbackslash}textgreater1 ha) were observed. In addition, clearing shrubland and extensive livestock provided other environmental benefits (i.e. mosaic landscapes, ecosystem services). Finally, this study suggested that they are good and sustainable techniques to prevent and control wildfires and they could be used as a land management strategy in other Mediterranean areas.},

In this fashion the ski industry, which offers seasonal services to a mostly urban clientele, contributes to the redefinition of peripheral rural areas taking into account urban needs.

The forest tended to recover to pre-disturbance conditions, both with respect to the magnitude of the NDVI and in terms of the spatial pattern. We found that the spatial differences in the rates of NDVI recovery were not affected by the burn severity. Moreover, burn severity did not affect the rates of NDVI recovery after the fire. Although highly homogeneous P. halepensis regeneration was the dominant pattern in the study area (more than the 70\% of the burn area showed positive and significant trends), some spatial differences in the magnitude of change were observed.

	abstract = {Farmland abandonment in Europe is a major problem because of environmental, socioeconomic and landscape implications. In this paper, a general view of the extent of abandoned land, the stages of abandonment and the drivers that manage this process in Europe is presented. A scientific literature review shows an abandonment at the beginning of the 19th century, although the largest abandonment in terms of area took place in the mid-20th century. This abandonment had a far greater impact on mountain areas because of rural depopulation as well as biophysical constraints. Since the last decades of the 20th century, abandonment driven by the CAP in European Member States and by the end of the communist regime in Central and Eastern Europe has been taking place. This abandonment affects peripheral marginal areas due to biophysical or socioeconomic conditions. Semi-arid areas in Southern Europe have also seen an important extent of abandoned land over the last few decades. The literature draws on the ongoing abandonment from the following decades, and 3–4\% of current farmland is considered to be affected. It is noted that, among the drivers, external factors (migration, socioeconomic model, public policies, etc.) act as enhancers that emphasize land abandonment. However, internal causes (agro-ecological and socioeconomic factors and also the features of agricultural holdings) control the dynamics and the extent of this phenomenon. The international literature about land abandonment in Europe is vast, and most of the specialized production is devoted to the effects of land abandonment, while few works determine the extent, stages and drivers of land abandonment. Finally, it is necessary to review the grey literature to obtain more quantitative information on the amount of abandoned land in Europe.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean areas of both southern Europe and North Africa are subject to dramatic changes that will affect the sustainability, quantity, quality, and management of water resources. Most climate models forecast an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation at the end of the 21st century. This will enhance stress on natural forests and shrubs, and will result in more water consumption, evapotranspiration, and probably interception, which will affect the surface water balance and the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater flow. As a consequence, soil water content will decline, saturation conditions will be increasingly rare and restricted to periods in winter and spring, and snow accumulation and melting will change, especially in the mid-mountain areas. Future land management will be characterized by forest and shrub expansion in most Mediterranean mountain areas, as a consequence of farmland and grazing abandonment, with increasing human pressure localized only in some places (ski resort and urbanized of valley floors). In the lowlands, particularly in the coastal fringe, increasing water demand will occur as a consequence of expansion of irrigated lands, as well as the growth of urban and industrial areas, and tourist resorts.Future scenarios for water resources in the Mediterranean region suggest (1) a progressive decline in the average streamflow (already observed in many rivers since the 1980s), including a decline in the frequency and magnitude of the most frequent floods due to the expansion of forests; (2) changes in important river regime characteristics, including an earlier decline in high flows from snowmelt in spring, an intensification of low flows in summer, and more irregular discharges in winter; (3) changes in reservoir inputs and management, including lower available discharges from dams to meet the water demand from irrigated and urban areas. Most reservoirs in mountain areas will be subject to increasing water resource uncertainty, because of the reduced influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes. Besides, reservoir capacity is naturally reduced due to increasing sedimentation and, in some cases, is also decreased to improve the safety control of floods, leading to a reduction in efficiency for agriculture. And (4) hydrological and population changes in coastal areas, particularly in the delta zones, affected by water depletion, groundwater reduction and saline water intrusion. These scenarios enhance the necessity of improving water management, water prizing and water recycling policies, in order to ensure water supply and to reduce tensions among regions and countries. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The evolution is characterized by a generalised revegetation process with an advance of shrubs and forests. The medium and low slopes show the most intense revegetation as a consequence of the agricultural abandonment and the decrease of the livestock pressure. Nevertheless, few vegetation changes are recorded in cultivated lands and the pastures located above timberline. In the analysed period, the most important changes were recorded in the decades of 1960 and 1970 whereas in the decades of 1980 and 1990 the rate of vegetation growth has decreased noticeably. The socioeconomic factors (agricultural abandonment, livestock extensification and reforestations) affect the spatial and temporal patterns of revegetation. Also the relief has a noticeable influence, mainly elevation and aspect.},

The selected images correspond to August of 1984, 1991 and 2001. The difference in days between the images was not very important to diminish the effects of phenology. The images were geometrically and atmospherically corrected by means of a mixed method based on physical and statistical procedures. Using the NDVI images we calculated coefficients of variation within a radius of 150 meters by means of a moving window procedure. This approach allows to analyse the spatial variability of the vegetation cover. The results show that the NDVI changes have not been important in the analysed period. Nevertheless, there are noticeable modifications in the spatial structure and variability of the NDVI, resulted in homogenization/ heterogenisation processes. The forests located at high altitudes have suffered the most important homogenisation processes. On the contrary at low elevated areas the spatial diversity of the vegetation activity increases. Nevertheless, in these areas some spatial differences are found: the heterogenisation of the vegetation cover is less important in the forests than in areas dominated by sclerophyllous vegetation and those characterised by the transition from shrubs to forests. These areas show less mature successional phases after the land abandonment and they are characterised by an increase of the spatial heterogeneity of the NDVI.},

In this paper, revegetation impacts are identified. We present the solutions proposed by scientists to control the negative impacts of revegetation, from a literature review from studies carried out in Europe. Results: Some scientists suggest letting the revegetation process continued to contribute to the naturalisation of the landscape, reduce soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration and encourage recreational use of the territory. Other scientists, however, suggest the need to control the revegetation processes and retrieve abandoned land with productive purposes (extensive livestock and leisure), environmental objectives (reduction of fires and increasing biodiversity) and preserve cultural landscapes. Conclusion: The scrubland clearing and extensive livestock is an appropriate strategy to manage abandoned lands, combining environmental, landscape and socio-economic benefits.},

	abstract = {The environmental, cultural and economic consequences of land use change, including abandonment of agricultural use, have been recognized for a long time. It has often been assumed that the transformations of the agricultural systems in developed countries (and particularly in Europe) took place, for the main part, in the immediate years after the Second World War. In this paper we present a review of different statistical and cartographic sources available for a peripheral region in Europe (Galicia, Spain) characterized by small-scale farming and a very fragmented property system, that suggests otherwise: modernization of agriculture apparently took place without major changes in agricultural area until the country gained access to the European Economic Community, and the effect of Common Agricultural Policy reforms during the decade of 1990 is suggested as a major driver for the net decrease of agricultural area in the region between 1956 and 2004. On the other hand, this paper emphasizes the spatial complexity of agricultural abandonment with a case study, showing a large degree of variability at municipal scale and thus the need of future EU-level projects to work at least at municipal (Local Administrative Units 2, LAU 2) level. Finally, a multinomial logistic model for observed changes is included that shows how biophysical limitations were the main drivers behind abandonment of agriculture at parcel scale, while structural qualities related to property structure were strongly associated to the incorporation of former shrublands to agricultural use. Besides, Farm Structure Surveys were revealed as an unreliable source for the assessment of changes in total agricultural area in the studied region.},

	abstract = {Agricultural activities and their complex effects on nature conservation, and the services that ecosystems deliver to humans are controversial. We present an overview of land abandonment, its driving forces and its consequences for landscape, biodiversity and humans. A descriptive metaanalysis of independently published studies highlighted the fact that the abandonment of agricultural land is a phenomenon mostly driven by socio-economic factors such as immigration into areas where new economic opportunities are offered to rural people. Ecological drivers such as elevation and land mismanagement leading to soil erosion are of secondary importance. We identiﬁed the major problems related to abandonment of agricultural land and quantiﬁed their relative importance. In order of decreasing importance, they were biodiversity loss, increase of ﬁre frequency and intensity, soil erosion and desertiﬁcation, loss of cultural and/or aesthetic values, reduction of landscape diversity and reduction of water provision. The impacts of these problems were not equally relevant in all regions of the world. The abandonment of agricultural land may also beneﬁt humans. The beneﬁts include passive revegetation and active reforestation, water regulation, soil recovery, nutrient cycling and increased biodiversity and wilderness. In a world that is becoming less natural and more intensively exploited by humans, we suggest that (1) farmland must be viewed in a context of multi-functionality to take advantage of ecosystem goods and services, (2) at the global scale, the abandonment of agricultural land is mostly positive for humans and (3) there is a need for the implementation of policies based on the payments for environmental services that encourage human societies to reconcile agricultural use, nature conservation and ecological restoration.},

Dasymetric mapping techniques that use ancillary information to disaggregate data within a spatial unit help to bridge this gap. This paper presents dasymetric maps showing the population density and a unit value of residential assets for whole Germany. A dasymetric mapping approach, which uses land cover data (CORINE Land Cover) as ancillary variable, was adapted and applied to regionalize aggregated census data that are provided for all communities in Germany. The results were validated by two approaches. First, it was ascertained whether population data disaggregated at the community level can be used to estimate population in postcodes. Secondly, disaggregated population and asset data were used for a loss evaluation of two ﬂood events that occurred in 1999 and 2002, respectively. It must be concluded that the algorithm tends to underestimate the population in urban areas and to overestimate population in other land cover classes. Nevertheless, ﬂood loss evaluations demonstrate that the approach is capable of providing realistic estimates of the number of exposed people and assets. Thus, the maps are sufﬁcient for applications in large-scale risk assessments such as the estimation of population and assets exposed to natural and man-made hazards.},

The current research examines the performance of alternative sources of ancillary data, including imperviousness, road networks, and nighttime lights. Nationally available datasets were used in the analysis to allow for replicability. The performance of the techniques used to examine these sources was compared to areal weighting and traditional land cover techniques. Four states were used in the analysis, representing a range of different geographic regions: Connecticut, New Mexico, Oregon, and South Carolina. Ancillary data sources were used to estimate census block group population counts using census tracts as source zones, and the results were compared to the known block group population counts. Results indicate that the performance of dasymetric methods varies substantially among study areas, and no single technique consistently outperforms all others. The three best techniques are imperviousness with values greater than 75 percent removed, imperviousness with values greater than 60 percent removed, and land cover. Total imperviousness and roads perform slightly worse, with nighttime lights performing the worst compared to all other ancillary data types. All techniques performed better than areal weighting.},

This study aims to identify firesmart management strategies that promote wildfire hazard reduction, climate regulation ecosystem service and biodiversity conservation. Here we simulate fire-landscape dynamics, carbon sequestration and species distribution (116 vertebrates) in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Gerês-Xurés (NW Iberia). We envisage 11 scenarios resulting from different management strategies following four storylines: Business-as-usual (BAU), expansion of High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf), Fire-Smart forest management, and HNVf plus Fire-Smart. Fire-landscape simulations reveal an increase of up to 25\% of annual burned area. HNVf areas may counterbalance this increasing fire impact, especially when combined with fire-smart strategies (reductions of up to 50\% between 2031 and 2050). The Fire-Smart and BAU scenarios attain the highest estimates for total carbon sequestered. A decrease in habitat suitability (around 18\%) since 1990 is predicted for species of conservation concern under the BAU scenario, while HNVf would support the best outcomes in terms of conservation. Our study highlights the benefits of integrating fire hazard control, ecosystem service supply and biodiversity conservation to inform better decision-making in mountain landscapes of Southern Europe.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (ra- ters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater re- liability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, deve- loped to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable.

It builds on the previous review of 2001 devoted to the impacts of agricultural intensification in Western Europe. The focus countries are the UK, The Netherlands, Boreal and Baltic countries, Portugal, Hungary and Romania, representing a geographical spread across Europe, but additional reference is made to other countries. Despite many adjustments to agricultural policy, intensification of production in some regions and concurrent abandonment in others remain the major threat to the ecology of agro-ecosystems impairing the state of soil, water and air and reducing biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. The impacts also extend to surrounding terrestrial and aquatic systems through water and aerial contamination and development of agricultural infrastructures (e.g. dams and irrigation channels). Improvements are also documented regionally, such as successful support of farmland species, and improved condition of watercourses and landscapes. This was attributed to agricultural policy targeted at the environment, improved environmental legislation, and new market opportunities. Research into ecosystem services associated with agriculture may provide further pressure to develop policy that is targeted at their continuous provisioning, fostering motivation of land managers to continue to protect and enhance them.},

The main driving factors of post-abandonment forest landscape dynamics were assessed with a statistical modeling approach.
Results Forest expansion was the dominant landscape transition at both Italian mountain ranges, with an annual overall rate of 0.6\%. Forest expansion was more extensive at lower elevations in the Apennines where climate is less limiting and extensive abandoned croplands and pastures were available throughout the study period. Distance from pre-existing forest edges in the Alps and elevation in the Apennines emerged as the most important predictors.
Conclusions Forest expansion is most rapid where areas of recent agricultural abandonment coincide with favorable climatic conditions. Thus the prediction of forest landscape dynamics, in these mountain forests with a long history of cultural use, requires knowledge of how the magnitude and timing of land use changes intersect spatially and temporally with suitable conditions for tree establishment and growth.},

	abstract = {Land abandonment exacerbated by climate change has led to increased woody plant encroachment of mountain grasslands in many regions of the world. The present study assessed woody plant encroachment below potential tree line in the Central Pyrenees of Spain and the association of this encroachment with changes in land use. Remote sensing data from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) from the mid-1980s and mid-2000s were analyzed by supervised classification for identification of land cover types. The transition matrix indicated that shrublands were the most dynamic plant communities. Consequently, 21\% of cultivated areas, 19\% of dense grasslands, and 24\% of sparse grasslands became shrublands during the period analyzed, and 35\% of shrublands became forest. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to identify biophysical and anthropogenic factors that were significantly correlated with woody plant encroachment of dense and sparse grasslands. Distance to the nearest woody plant habitat (shrub or forest) was the most strongly correlated factor with woody plant encroachment of both types of grassland. This factor explained 69\% and 71\% of the variance in models of dense and sparse grasslands, respectively. Besides this factor, anthropogenic factors had larger effects on woody plant encroachment of dense grasslands, regions that were more productive and accessible. However, biophysical and especially topographic factors had slightly greater effects on woody plant encroachment of sparse grasslands, regions that were less productive and accessible. The changes in land cover that we observed indicated that land cover has become more homogeneous. There have been reductions in the variety, functions, and services of grasslands, particularly in areas below the potential tree line that are vulnerable to the development of woody plant habitats.},

	abstract = {Mountain grasslands provide valuable ecosystem services for sustainable development and human wellbeing. These habitats have suffered important changes related with their physiognomic (biomass) and physiologic (greenness) properties. Some of these changes received signiﬁcant attention i.e. woody encroachment, while others, like the changes in biomass and greenness of those grasslands that have not experienced woody encroachment are almost unknown. We calculated physiognomic and physiologic properties for dense grasslands not affected by woody encroachment through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper. Imagery taken in the late-1980s and late-2000s in the Spanish Pyrenees were analyzed with multi-temporal vectors to detect increases or decreases of biomass and greenness. To understand the source of these changes, we modeled them with anthropogenic (land use, i.e. grazing, ski resorts, and related infrastructures) and environmental factors (topographic, lithologic and climatic). Anthropogenic factors were most strongly correlated with decrease in the biomass and greenness, showing degradation patterns of the grasslands at localized patches. Nonetheless, environmental factors were most strongly correlated with positive changes in both indices, detecting a continuous pattern in the increase in biomass and greenness. In areas that had high livestock stocking rates, grasslands biomass and greenness decrease, while in areas that had low stocking rates, biomass and greenness increases. Grasslands at low elevation showing decrease in biomass and greenness were either on gentle slopes and largely affected by human activities, or on steep slopes locally affected by ski resorts. In areas that have been disturbed by anthropogenic factors, the increase of rain in early summer trigger erosion processes, enhancing the negative effect of anthropic pressure on grassland greenness and biomass. In contrast, grasslands at high elevations, on steep slopes, and those that had north or west aspects and that had an acidic lithology, with less continentality, and that received more rain, had the most increase in biomass and greenness. Those results suggest that changes in mountain grasslands, apart from woody encroachment, are deeply altering their physiology and physiognomy, pointing out direct relationships with current management practices and climate trends.},

	abstract = {Diversification of the farm income base represents a cornerstone of the European model of multifunctional agriculture (MFA) and rural development (RD) alongside the objectives of enhancing competitiveness and the sustainability of agriculture. A knowledge gap exists as to how farmers’ decisions to engage in non-agricultural activities, or to continue farming at all, is affected by landscape characteristics and the farm's location in the urban–rural system. This paper presents the results of research concerning the impact of spatial factors on diversification activities and farm abandonment. Based on a survey conducted among 147 farms in a case study area in Eastern Germany, spatially explicit data on farmers’ diversification activities and exit strategies were analysed using two spatial typologies that classify rural attractiveness and farm location on an urban–rural gradient. Results show that while rural attractiveness positively affects the farmers’ decision-making to diversify activities, the degree of urbanisation encourages farm holders to continue farming activity, i.e., the proximity and accessibility to urban consumer markets. Diversification rather seems to be associated with rurality and touristic development and not so much with the proximity to urban consumer markets.},

	abstract = {Accounting for more than half of the European Union’s (EU) territory, agriculture ensures food production, manages important natural resources and supports socio-economic development of rural areas. Moreover, it is estimated that 50\% of all plant and animal species (including some of that are listed in the EU Habitat Directive) depend on agricultural practices. The continuation of appropriate agricultural land management is essential to ensure these primary functions. Avoidance of farmland abandonment is therefore an important rationale for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy which requires improved knowledge of this phenomenon at the European level. This study assesses the risk of farmland abandonment in the 27 EU Member States. It summarizes the work performed by an expert panel of European scientists and national representatives which aimed to identify the main drivers of farmland abandonment in Europe, to define indicators for assessing its risk of occurrence and to test the value of European-wide data sources to achieve these aims. Drivers were identified under two rationales: low farm stability and viability, and negative regional context. Indicators were defined using recent socio-economic farm data and geospatial datasets. Some indicators were then combined to make a composite risk indicator. Regions with higher risk of farmland abandonment are located in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Ireland. This paper demonstrates the challenges of performing a European-wide assessment of a phenomenon influenced by drivers whose effects vary at local levels. Other problems encountered are data heterogeneity in terms of spatial resolution and quality, as well as access to micro-data (local level data). High spatial resolution European datasets measuring farmland abandonment are needed to validate the defined indicators as well as to benchmark the methodology. Furthermore, such data could be used to establish a weighting system for the drivers.},

Understanding the relative contribution of different drivers of deforestation is needed to guide policies seeking to maintain natural forest cover. We assessed 119 randomly selected plots from areas deforested between 2010 and 2017, in Tanzania. Through ground surveys and stakeholder interviews we assessed the proximate deforestation drivers at each point. Crop cultivation was the most commonly observed driver occurring in 89\% of plots, compared to livestock grazing (69\%) and charcoal (35\%). There was evidence of fire in 77\% of plots. Most deforestation events involved multiple drivers, with 83\% of plots showing signs of two or more drivers. Stakeholder interviews identified agriculture as the primary deforestation driver in 81\% of plots, substantially more than charcoal production (12\%), timber harvesting (1\%) and livestock (1\%). Policy-makers in Tanzania have sought to reduce deforestation by reducing demand for charcoal. However, our work demonstrates that agriculture, not charcoal, is the main driver of deforestation in Tanzania. Beyond protected areas, there is no clear policy limiting the conversion of forests to agricultural land. Reducing deforestation in Tanzania requires greater inter-sectoral coordination between the agriculture, livestock, land, energy and forest sectors.},

Given their more complex dynamics, alternative methodologies for analysing the spatial consequences of changes are required. The present study investigates the variables shaping the urbanerural relationship in Spain over the last 20 years using a synthesizing methodology based on statistical and cartographic techniques that take into account a large number of variables and cases. The study was carried out at the level of local municipalities (nearly 8000 spatial units), ﬁtting 36 socioeconomic and geographical indicators into a multivariate statistical framework. Indicators were selected to describe processes of intensiﬁcation, extensiﬁcation, or abandonment implying both land-use changes and important transformations in the local socioeconomic structure. Multivariate analysis identiﬁed seven processes contributing to the change in the urbanerural relationship in Spain: urban intensiﬁcation and sprawl, coastalization, naturbanization, expansion of irrigated crop systems, livestock and pasture expansion, afforestation and reforestation, and depopulation. An in-depth understanding of recent spatial dynamics in Mediterranean countries may inform sustainable land management with the ﬁnal aim to mitigate or re-balance the impact of these processes in land degradation or in an excessive human pressure along the coastal rim between other undesirable consequences.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land abandonment (ALA) is widespread in many countries of the global north. It impacts rural communities, traditional landscapes, biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is an opportunity for ecosystem restoration or new landscape functions. We explored ALA in study areas in Australia, Portugal and Sweden. In each, we assessed plant species diversity, historical trajectories of land cover change; and the socioeconomic past, present and future in interviews with farmers. The ALA data was integrated and analysed by identifying the drivers of change. The relative importance of each driver and its scale of action was estimated, both in the past (1950–2010) and in the future (2010–2030). ALA has transformed rural landscapes in the study areas of Portugal and Sweden. It is at a much earlier stage with potential to increase in the Australian case. We identified a set of driving forces, classified into pressures, frictions and attractors that clarify why ALA, noting its temporal and spatial scale, occurs differently in each study area. The effect of the drivers is related to social and historical contexts. Pressures and attractors encouraging agricultural abandonment are strongest in Portugal and Sweden. Generally more (institutionalized) frictions are in place in these European sites, intended to prevent further change, based on the benefits assumed for biodiversity and aesthetics. In Australia, the stimulation of driving forces to promote a well-managed abandonment of some cleared areas could be highly beneficial for biodiversity, minimally disruptive for current dairy farming operations and would bring opportunities for alternative types of rural development.},

	abstract = {Wildﬁre risk is increasing in the context of global change, and the need for accurate fuel model maps in broader areas is becoming urgent to manage large wildﬁres. Among remote sensing technologies, Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) is extremely useful for fuel mapping as it provides 3D information on vegetation distribution. A cost-effective methodology to obtain high-resolution fuel model maps in large forest areas from ALS data (1 pulse/m2) and Landsat-8 OLI images is presented. A two-phase approach was used to generate the fuel model maps: i) ad-hoc vegetation classiﬁcation derived from ALS and Landsat-8 OLI, and ii) fuel model assignment based on fuel complex structure from a limited number of ALS-derived metrics: fractional canopy cover, fuel height, and canopy relief ratio. Fuel model maps for the Canary Islands (Spain) were generated for two fuel classiﬁcation systems, standard Northern Forest Fire Laboratory (NFFL) and speciﬁc Canarian fuel models (CIFM), at 25 m resolution (3678 km2) according to decision rules based on ALS-derived metrics developed for each vegetation type. Fieldwork was used to validate the fuel model maps, obtaining an overall accuracy of 82\% (kappa = 0.777) and 70\% (kappa = 0.679) for the standard NFFL and CIFM fuel models respectively. Discrimination between fuel models associated to forests with and without understory was satisfactory, showing higher errors due to species composition classiﬁcation rather than to ALS-derived fuel structure. Errors due to underestimation of ALS-derived fuel cover and height were more evident in mixed grassland and shrubland fuels. Results demonstrated the potential of combining imagery and ALS for fuel model mapping at a large scale from existing data sources, even with low laser pulse density and temporarily mismatched data sets. The proposed methodology may be applied for fuel mapping in other large areas provided that ALS information is available and that fuel model deﬁnition has explicit structure characteristics allowing decision rules based on ALS data. Once algorithms are deﬁned for fuel model assignment, the low number of ALS-derived metrics and the semi-automated processing ensures that fuel model maps can be easily updated as new data sources become available providing managers with useful spatial information in large areas.},

	abstract = {Land cover mapping obtained from photointerpretation of aerial photographs and orthophotographs was used to quantify land cover changes between 1957 and 1996 in a Mediterranean middle mountain area. Expansion of forested area is clearly the main land cover change caused by the abandonment of traditional agricultural activities and by the use of other materials and energy sources instead of forest resources. As a result, about 64\% of the area was covered by forest by 1996, whereas in 1957 forests accounted for only 40\% of the land cover. Spontaneous afforestation of abandoned fields with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in terraced areas and areas of sparse scrub vegetation, coupled with an increase in the density of forest canopies, has been responsible for this expansion of woodland. The influence of physiographic factors in land cover change processes in the terraced areas of the catchment was also considered. The results demonstrate that within the terraced areas, north-facing and more elevated steeper slopes are more intensely afforested. However, an accurate analysis of the role played by these factors in land cover change cannot be carried out because the pattern of land abandonment is not independent of these physiographic characteristics. Furthermore, field observations at the terrace scale are evidence of the relevant influence of local topography in afforestation dynamics.},

	abstract = {As other Mediterranean areas, Catalonia has experienced a forest transition following rural abandonment during the last sixty years. The GIS reconstruction of three land-use maps of 1868, 1956 and 2005 shows how forests have encroached former cropland and pasture land from the 1950s onwards, after a previous wave of deforestation. Forest inventories reveal the overpressure exerted on woodlands up to the 1950s, and their poor ecological status in terms of age structure, diversity and maturity. They are prone to wildfires, which in turn force a harvest of salvaged wood by a sudden forestry activity that entails a vicious circle: the lack of a proper forest management increases wildfires, and leads to this sort of ‘spasmodic forestry'. To overcome this situation, a sustainable forestry, combined with farming and extensive livestock breeding are needed as a means to perform an active ecological restoration. Historical knowledge can help in this task, by discovering the previous dynamics of current woodlands and providing a guidance to differentiate the scarce oldest forests from the ones that are younger as a result of the overuse exerted up to mid-20th century, and from many others that have regrown since the 1950s in abandoned steep lands.},

	abstract = {Leaf-off individual trees in a deciduous forest in the eastern USA are detected and analysed in small footprint, high sampling density lidar data. The data were acquired February 1, 2001, using a SAAB TopEye laser profiling system, with a sampling density of approximately 12 returns per square meter. The sparse and complex configuration of the branches of the leaf-off forest provides sufficient returns to allow the detection of the trees as individual objects and to analyse their vertical structures. Initially, for the detection of the individual trees only, the lidar data are first inserted in a 2D digital image, with the height as the pixel value or brightness level. The empty pixels are interpolated, and height outliers are removed. Gaussian smoothing at different scales is performed to create a three-dimensional scale-space structure. Blob signatures based on second-order image derivatives are calculated, and then normalised so they can be compared at different scale-levels. The grey-level blobs with the strongest normalised signatures are selected within the scale-space structure. The support regions of the blobs are marked one-at-a-time in the segmentation result image with higher priority for stronger blobs. The segmentation results of six individual hectare plots are assessed by a computerised, objective method that makes use of a ground reference data set of the individual tree crowns. For analysis of individual trees, a subset of the original laser returns is selected within each tree crown region of the canopy reference map. Indices based on moments of the first four orders, maximum value and number of canopy and ground returns, are estimated. The indices are derived separately for height and laser reflectance of branches for the two echoes. Significant differences (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) are detected for numerous indices for three major native species groups: oaks (Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tuliperifera). Tree species classification results of different indices suggest a moderate to high degree of accuracy using single or multiple variables. Furthermore, the maximum tree height is compared to ground reference tree height for 48 sample trees and a 1.1-m standard error (R2 = 68\% (adj.)) within the test-site is observed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

	abstract = {Agricultural areas are declining in many areas of the world, often because socio-economic and political changes make agriculture less profitable. The transition from centralized to market-oriented economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after 1989 represented major economic and political changes, yet the resulting rates and spatial pattern of post-socialist farmland abandonment remain largely unknown. Remote sensing offers unique opportunities to map farmland abandonment, but automated assessments are challenging because phenology and crop types often vary substantially. We developed a change detection method based on support vector machines (SVM) to map farmland abandonment in the border triangle of Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine in the Carpathians from Landsat TM/ETM+ images from 1986, 1988, and 2000. Our SVM-based approach yielded an accurate change map (overall accuracy = 90.9\%; kappa = 0.82), underpinning the potential of SVM to map complex land-use change processes such as farmland abandonment. Farmland abandonment was widespread in the study area (16.1\% of the farmland used in socialist times), likely due to decreasing profitability of agriculture after 1989. We also found substantial differences in abandonment among the countries (13.9\% in Poland, 20.7\% in Slovakia, and 13.3\% in Ukraine), and between previously collectivized farmland and farmland that remained private during socialism in Poland. These differences are likely due to differences in socialist land ownership patterns, post-socialist land reform strategies, and rural population density. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Farmland abandonment is a widespread land-use change in temperate regions, due to increasing yields on productive lands, conservation policies, and the increasing imports of agricultural products from other regions. Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1\% (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9\%), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4\% of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1. Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6. Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 11.2. Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.},

	abstract = {Land abandonment is a global issue with important implications in Mediterranean mountain areas. Abandoned Mediterranean croplands start a process of secondary succession that is initially colonized by grasslands, shrubs and forest. In Mediterranean mountain areas, the process is very slow, so the shrubs remain for decades, preventing livestock from accessing pastureland. Therefore, farmers have to burn or clear the shrubs in order to provide pasture, a practice that has recently been encouraged by several regional governments in Spain. Data from experimental plots of the Aísa Valley Experimental Station in the Spanish Pyrenees allow to evaluate the effects of burning and clearing shrubs on physical and chemical soil properties, runoff production and soil erosion rates. The results suggested that clearing shrubs returned more positive results than burning, as it improved soil quality and slowed soil erosion while producing slightly higher runoff coefficients, which is very important in Mediterranean environments where water is a scarce resource. Clearing shrubs improves soil characteristics by increasing organic matter and CN ratio, which promote the expansion of herbaceous species with a high pastoral value. The results suggested that the policy of clearing shrubs is suitable for managing abandoned lands in Mediterranean mountain areas. Further studies at catchment scale will be needed to confirm the impact of substituting shrubs for meadows and to understand the connectivity of the flows measured from pedon and slope to the watershed scale.

We reconstructed the population dynamics of mountain pine (Pinus mugo Turra spp. mugo) in the subalpine belt of the Majella National Park (Italy). In a test area of 14,440 ha, proposed as a pilot study site for long-term ecological monitoring, temporal and spatial mountain pine distribution were examined since 1954 by historical aerial ortophotos. Multitemporal maps documented the expansion upwards (1 m/year) and downwards (3 m/year) of mountain pine. Mountain pine started to expand upwards into the formerly tree-free grassland in early 1900s, in association with a decline of the local human population and livestock.

	abstract = {A vegetation cover increase has been identified at global scales using satellite images and vegetation indices. This fact is usually explained by global climatic change processes such as CO2 and temperature increases. Nevertheless, although these causes can be important, the role of socioeconomic transformations must be considered in some places, since in several areas of Northern Hemisphere an important change in management practices has been detected. Rural depopulation and land abandonment have reactivated the natural vegetation regeneration processes. This work analyses the vegetation evolution in the central Spanish Pyrenees from 1982 to 2000. The analysis has been done by using calibrated-NDVI temporal series from NOAA-AVHRR images. A positive and significant trend in NDVI data has been identified from 1982 to 2000 coinciding with a temperature increase in the study area. However, the spatial differences in magnitude and the sign of NDVI trends are significant. The role of land management changes in the 20th century is considered as a hypothesis to explain the spatial differences in NDVI trends. The role of land-cover and human land-uses on this process has been analyzed. The highest increment of NDVI is detected in lands affected by abandonment and human extensification. The importance of management changes in vegetation growth is discussed and we indicate that although climate has great importance in vegetal evolution, land-management changes can not be neglected in our study area. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract = {Agricultural abandonment reflects a post war trend in western Europe of rural depopulation to which isolated and poorer areas are most vulnerable. The commercialisation of agriculture, through technological developments, and the influence of Common Agricultural Policy have increased productivity and focused agricultural activity on more fertile and accessible land thus transforming traditional approaches to farming. In many areas this has lead to a decline in traditional labour intensive practices and marginal agricultural land is being abandoned. The problems that these trends create are particularly marked in mountain areas. The social and economic impacts of these changes have been well documented. However, the implications for environmental policy are less well recognised. This paper reviews the literature on abandonment and gives a comparative analysis of European mountain case studies to assess the environmental impacts of land abandonment and decline in traditional farming practices. It finds abandonment is widespread and that, while the influence of environmental changes is unpredictable due to environmental, agricultural and socio-economic contextual factors, abandonment generally has an undesirable effect on the environmental parameters examined. The application of agri-environment policy measures in relation to abandonment is discussed and suggestions for future policy are proposed. © 2000 Academic Press.},

The purpose was to identify abrupt changes suggesting modification of the land cover category, and gradual changes not associated with a change in the land cover type but potentially indicative of significant changes in natural areas. The results showed that: i) in analysis of land cover change the seasonality of vegetation cover is an important factor that must be taken into account in identifying the various change processes that may affect a region; ii) the major land cover changes in the study area were related to very diverse processes including urban expansion, industrial activities, the establishment of land irrigation, land extensification, natural revegetation following rural abandonment, forest fires, and changes in natural vegetated areas related to global warming and drought. With the exception of the occurrence of forest fires, the changes in natural areas (forest, shrubs and steppes) tended to be gradual with respect to both positive (forest colonization following rural abandonment and land extensification) and negative (land degradation and forest decline) processes. These areas showed rates of change that were lower in magnitude than those directly transformed by human activities. We found that time series of high spatial resolution satellite images and the application of change statistics provided a useful approach to the identification of abrupt changes, and gradual land cover change processes that are not commonly revealed using classical analytical approaches. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

This yielded a decline in the number of plant species and fragmentation of their populations. Understanding of the impact of land use changes on the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest species is essential to the ecological sustainability of the natural forests in the region. In this study, we examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of Q. faginea forests in the Central Pre-Pyrenees (Spain) over period from 1957 to 2006. Gains and losses in Q. faginea forests were quantified by means of construction of matrix of changes. Patch fragmentation, isolation, and irregularity were assessed using a set of standard landscape metrics. Also, the probable factors influencing these changes were identified employing three statistical models. The univariate generalized additive model (GAM) was used to explore the nature of the relationship between the response and predictor variables. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and the adaptative regression mixed with model screening (ARMS) were employed to identify the most important factors affecting changes in Quercus faginea forests. The results of this research revealed substantial changes in the spatial patterns of Q. faginea forests in the Central Pre-Pyrenees over the last 50 years. These changes have been clearly reflected in noteworthy increase of fragmentation, isolation degrees, and patch irregularity. Changes in the spatial patterns of Q. faginea forests were particularly driven by the vast introduction of pine plantations and the former deforestation, associated with increasing the amount of croplands and pastures. In addition, roads acted as attractors for changes in land use and deforestation, which influenced strongly the spatial variability in Q. faginea forests. Therefore, the long-term sustainability of these forests largely depends on the landscape conservation, where this species occurs. Moreover, an improvement in the integrity and connectivity of the remaining patches of native Q. faginea forests is still demanded. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Moreover, they each provide a graphical display and a quality index reflecting the strength of the clustering. The powerful graphics of S-PLUS made it possible to improve these graphical representations considerably. The integration of the clustering algorithms was performed according to the object-oriented principle supported by S-PLUS. The new functions have a uniform interface, and are compatible with existing S-PLUS functions. We will describe the basic idea and the use of each clustering method, together with its graphical features. Each function is briefly illustrated with an example.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean pines are subject to continuous change under the influence of natural and human factors. Remotely sensed data provide a means to characterize these changes over large areas. In this study we used a time series of Landsat imagery to capture 25 years (1984-2009) of change in the pine-dominated forests of the Central Range in Spain. Object-based image analysis methods were used to identify landscape-level changes in the area and the distribution of forests. We also propose that in the absence of disturbance, biomass accrual is occurring (or depletion in cases where removal is evident) and may be related to changes to the carbon stock; we describe the detected spectral changes in terms of biomass changes as the carbon stocking process. The primary inputs for the identification of changes in the area and distribution of pine stands were Landsat bands 3, 4 and 5 and the Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA) - a metric derived from the greenness and brightness components of the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT). In the identification of carbon stocking processes the temporal derivative of the TCA, the Process Indicator (PI), was used to inform on the rate and directionality of the change present. Our results show that the total area of pine forest has increased by 40\%, from 1211 km2 to 1698 km2, during this period, with a variable rate of change. The distribution of pine-dominated forest has changed as well: there is an area of 765 km2 permanently covered with pines and 945 km2 found to be temporarily occupied. Following the logic of carbon stocking processes, our findings show that at the end of the analysis period, 20\% of the potential pine area is increasing its carbon stock and 40\% of this area is experiencing a decrease. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Long thought to be the product of deforestation, diverse lines of evidence indicate that many open ecosystems are ancient. They have also been characterized as ‘early successional' even where they persist for millennia. ABS is an alternative framework to that of climate determinism and succession for exploring forest/nonforest mosaics. This framework explains not only tropical forest–savanna landscapes, but also other landscape mosaics across the globe.},

	abstract = {Landsat satellite data has become ubiquitous in regional-scale forest disturbance detection. The Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation for Landsat data has been used in several disturbance-mapping projects because of its ability to highlight relevant vegetation changes. We used an automated composite analysis procedure to test four multi-date variants of the TC transformation (called "data structures" here) in their ability to facilitate identification of stand-replacing disturbance. Data structures tested included one with all three TC indices (brightness, greenness, wetness), one with just brightness and greenness, one with just wetness, and one called the Disturbance Index (DI) which is a novel combination of the three TC indices. Data structures were tested in the St. Petersburg region of Russia and in two ecologically distinct regions of Washington State in the US. In almost all cases, the TC variants produced more accurate change classifications than multi-date stacks of the original Landsat reflectance data. In general, there was little overall difference between the TC-derived data structures. However, DI performed better than the others at the Russian study area, where slower succession rates likely produce the most durable disturbance signal. Also, at the highly productive western Washington site, where the disturbance signal is likely the most ephemeral, DI and wetness performed worse than the larger data structures when a longer monitoring interval was used (eight years between image acquisitions instead of four). This suggests that both local forest recovery rates and the re-sampling interval should be considered in choosing a Landsat transformation for use in stand-replacing disturbance detection. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Changes over the last century in the economic model of European countries and the development of the market economy have led to intense shifts in land occupation patterns. Agricultural abandonment is an important consequence of these processes and has modified natural and cultural landscapes, involving side-effects for society. Understanding how environmental and socio-economic factors influence the abandonment process can provide useful insights for managing investments, whether from the public or the private sector. In Spain, the Pyrenees and the Ebro Depression are two differentiated areas in terms of land-use dynamics, particularly in terms of the agricultural model carried out. In this paper we have analyzed the agricultural abandonment in these areas during the 1987–2012 period in relation to several potential explanatory factors. The analysis focuses on the abandonment of rainfed and irrigated herbaceous crops in order to derive specific explanations according to the crop type and geographical region. Crop covers were classified from four Landsat scenes, and conditions were described by topographic variables, human factors and drought occurrence. Boosted regression trees (BRT) were used to identify the most important variables and to describe the relationships between agricultural abandonment and key factors. Topography derived variables were found to be the main determinants, except for irrigated crops in the Ebro Basin, where locational factors play a more important role. BRT models allowed us to identify other significant patterns such as: the vulnerability of irrigated crops to drought; the higher dependence of agricultural activity in the Pyrenees on internal networks; pattern shifts of land abandonment in the analyzed sub-periods, and; evidence of the importance of economic diversification for maintaining cropland.},

	abstract = {Land degradation affects natural and cultivated socio-ecosystems worldwide. Soil erosion is one of the main processes leading to land degradation, and the process is accelerated by human actions. Spain is dealing with extensive land degradation caused by land use and land cover change (LULCC), for instance by land abandonment, and local geo-ecological conditions. Recent land abandonment in Spain can be largely related to changing policies and international market development, which have resulted in the reallocation of agriculture and a shift from traditional rainfed crops to intensification of irrigated agriculture. This radical change in LULCC by land abandonment resulted in two opposite trends, towards greening-up and towards land degradation, each with enormous consequences for the environment by its effects on soil hydrology, runoff, sediment sources, soil erosion, fluvial channel adjustments and forest fire risks. To mitigate negative effects, appropriate management and conservation strategies are necessary. In this review, we analyze the top-down policy framework of soil conservation in Spain, with a specific focus on the Region of Murcia. We found that multiple international policies, i.e. the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the European Water Framework Directive and the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), contribute to soil and water conservation at the national level, where the national administration selects most appropriate measures according to the country's current state. These measures are incorporated in national policies, such as the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification and the National Rural Development Programme. In case of the CAP, agro-environmental subsidies are an instrument to promote soil protection at a national level. Regionally adjusted sub-measures, based on regional environmental characteristics, are then integrated in the Regional Rural Development Programmes of the Spanish Autonomous Communities. The application of subsidies, related to soil protection, is found to be controversial, as studies do not agree upon its effect on soil erosion and land degradation control. To improve decision-making, concepts such as the ecosystem service approach and nature-based solutions are suggested to be included in future policies, as these concepts aim to improve the status of the entire ecosystem in a more holistic manner than is currently the case.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of sediment connectivity associated with different land use and topographic changes is a prerequisite for a better understanding of sediment budgets and sediment transport processes. We used the Index of Sediment Connectivity (IC) developed by Cavalli et al. (2013) based on the original approach by Borselli et al. (2008) to study the effects of decadal-scale land use and topographic changes on sediment connectivity in mountain catchments. The input variables of the IC (i.e. land cover and topography) were derived from historical aerial photos using Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo algorithms (SfM-MVS). The method was applied in different sub-catchments of the Upper River Cinca Catchment (Central Pyrenees), representative of three scenarios: (a) Land cover changes; (b) Topographic changes in agricultural fields (terracing); and (c) Topographic changes associated with infrastructure (road construction). In terms of land cover changes, results show that although connectivity is increased in some areas due to the establishment of new field crops, for most of the study area connectivity decreased due to afforestation caused by rural abandonment. Topographic changes due to the establishment of agricultural terraces affected connectivity to a larger degree than land cover changes. Terracing generally reduced connectivity due to the formation of flat areas in step-slopes, but in certain points, an increase in connectivity caused by the topographic convergence produced by terraces was observed. Finally, topographic changes associated with road construction greatly modified surface flow directions and the drainage network, resulting in changes in connectivity that may affect erosional processes nearby. The methodology used in this paper allows to study the effects of real decadal-scale land use and topographic changes on sediment connectivity and also evaluating and disentangling those changes. Furthermore, this approach can be a useful tool to identify potential risks associated with morphological and land use changes, involving road infrastructures.},

	abstract = {This study explored and applied the concepts of Fire Regulation Capacity (FRC) and Fire Protection Ecosystem Service (FPES) in the assessment of the effects of landscape change in a mountain fire-prone landscape in Portugal. We adopted a modeling and simulation approach using BFOLDS-FRM with landscape data for years 1990 and 2006 (observed) and with three landscape scenarios for 2020. Proxy indicators for FRC (burned area and fire intensity) and for economic damage by fire (loss of provisioning ES) were used to establish trends in the supply and value of FPES. We found decreased FRC to restrain simulated fires burning over 100 ha from 1990 on and to regulate Very High and Extreme fire intensity levels, particularly under our 2020 scenario of Forest expansion. FPES is also expected to decrease, as indicated by higher fire-related damages, particularly if fuel hazard increases in the landscape. However, there were differences among scenarios, suggesting potential trade-offs between FPES and the supply of provisioning ES. Planning and management in this and similar areas experiencing farmland abandonment must consider fire trends and patterns, since landscape change is a major driver affecting FRC and FPES, which may further be decreased by future climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {In southern European regions, the few fires that escape initial attack (IA) account for most of the burned area. Nonetheless, limited effort has been conducted to develop spatiotemporal models aiming at improving pre-positioning and deployment of fire-fighting brigades on the first dispatch. To this end, we calibrated a model to assess the probability of containment of fire by IA in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). The model was trained using machine learning algorithms from georeferenced historical fire ignition locations, fire response and weather conditions. Our results indicated that early detection, ground accessibility, and aerial support governed the broad spatial pattern of fire containment probability, with strong gradients that ranged from lowest chances of containment in northwestern mountains to highest in the coastal belt. In turn, weather conditions and fire simultaneity were crucial to explain the differences during wildfire season. We found that fires igniting above the 85th percentile of temperature and wind speed, during simultaneous fire episodes (n {\textbackslash}textgreater 10), and 12.5 km away from the nearest fire station will probably escape IA, and grow into large events. These hazardous fire danger conditions were met 13 days per year on average during the period 1998–2015, with 5 fire simultaneous episodes escaping IA that burned 1546 ha in total. Results were provided as a set of high-resolution raster grids (100 m), which replicated the most typical weather and fire occurrence scenarios that first responders are likely to face during the wildfire season. This study reveals existing limitations in the dominant fire exclusion policy of Mediterranean areas and advocates for a comprehensive long-term wildfire management solution. Our model may help inform science-based decision-making on IA and general fire response planning in the study area.},

	abstract = {Forest fires represent a major driver of change at the ecosystem and landscape levels in the Mediterranean region. Environmental features and vegetation are key factors to estimate the ecological vulnerability to fire; defined as the degree to which an ecosystem is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of fire (provided a fire occurs). Given the predicted climatic changes for the region, it is urgent to validate spatially explicit tools for assessing this vulnerability in order to support the design of new fire prevention and restoration strategies. This work presents an innovative GIS-based modelling approach to evaluate the ecological vulnerability to fire of an ecosystem, considering its main components (soil and vegetation) and different time scales. The evaluation was structured in three stages: short-term (focussed on soil degradation risk), medium-term (focussed on changes in vegetation), and coupling of the short- and medium-term vulnerabilities. The model was implemented in two regions: Aragón (inland North-eastern Spain) and Valencia (eastern Spain). Maps of the ecological vulnerability to fire were produced at a regional scale. We partially validated the model in a study site combining two complementary approaches that focused on testing the adequacy of model's predictions in three ecosystems, all very common in fireprone landscapes of eastern Spain: two shrublands and a pine forest. Both approaches were based on the comparison of model's predictions with values of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which is considered a good proxy for green biomass. Both methods showed that the model's performance is satisfactory when applied to the three selected vegetation types. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies.

	abstract = {Monitoring and classifying forest disturbance using Landsat time series has improved greatly over the past decade, with many new algorithms taking advantage of the high-quality, cost free data in the archive. Much of the innovation has been focused on use of sophisticated workflows that consist of a logical sequence of processes and rules, multiple statistical functions, and parameter sets that must be calibrated to accurately classify disturbance. For many algorithms, calibration has been local to areas of interest and the algorithm's classification performance has been good under those circumstances. When applied elsewhere, however, algorithm performance has suffered. An alternative strategy for calibration may be to use the locally tested parameter values in conjunction with a statistical approach (e.g., Random Forests; RF) to align algorithm classification with a reference disturbance dataset, a process we call secondary classification. We tested that strategy here using RF with LandTrendr, an algorithm that runs on one spectral band or index. Disturbance detection using secondary classification was spectral band- or index-dependent, with each spectral dimension providing some unique detections and different error rates. Using secondary classification, we tested whether an integrated multispectral LandTrendr ensemble, with various combinations of the six basic Landsat reflectance bands and seven common spectral indices, improves algorithm performance. Results indicated a substantial reduction in errors relative to secondary classification based on single bands/indices, revealing the importance of a multispectral approach to forest disturbance detection. To explain the importance of specific bands and spectral indices in the multispectral ensemble, we developed a disturbance signal-to-noise metric that clearly highlighted the value of shortwave-infrared reflectance, especially when paired with near-infrared reflectance.},

We developed approaches to create disturbance and regrowth maps for forests within the area of the NWFP from the results of LandTrendr, a temporal segmentation algorithm described previously only at the pixel scale. Maps were developed from 674 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper. + images distributed across 22 separate scene areas, and were assessed for validity at 2360 points using TimeSync, a time-series validation and interpretation tool. Unlike maps derived using other techniques, maps derived from the segmentation approach were unique in providing simultaneous detection of abrupt disturbance, chronic disturbance, and ongoing vegetative growth with consistency across large areas and across time. Maps were then used to address six core monitoring questions focusing on the distribution of disturbance across time, ownership categories, and ecoregions. Forest was disturbed at rates that varied by ownership category and state, ranging from 9\% to {\textbackslash}textgreater. 39\% of forest area over the period 1985 to 2008, with highest cumulative disturbed area on private and native lands in Washington and Oregon and lowest disturbed area on federal protected lands in Washington. Effects of court injunctions and subsequent implementation of the NWFP lowered forest disturbance rates, particularly in Oregon, and also caused decreases in the relative magnitude of disturbance on those lands relative to private lands. State-managed forests showed forest disturbance rates that varied considerably among the three states, with the highest rates in Washington state and lowest in California. Affected by large, stochastic fire events, protected lands in both Oregon and California showed disturbance rates similar to those found on actively managed federal lands. Protected lands also experienced high rates of chronic disturbance, often associated with insect-related mortality. As expected, moisture-limited ecoregions recovered vegetation more slowly than those where moisture was not limiting. Vegetative regrowth rates showed substantial variation among ownership categories, suggesting that differential forest policies may affect vegetative recovery rate. Taken together, these results emphasize that forest management policies do have manifestations at the landscape scale, but that detection of these manifestations is best achieved with mapping approaches that can detect both abrupt and longer-duration processes within the Landsat archive. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In contrast, the political breakdown in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union triggered rapid and widespread farmland abandonment, but the spatial patterns of abandonment and its drivers are not well understood. Our goal was to map post-socialist farmland abandonment in Western Ukraine using Landsat images from 1986 to 2008, and to identify spatial determinants of abandonment using a combination of best-subsets linear regression models and hierarchical partitioning. Our results suggest that farmland abandonment was widespread in the study region, with abandonment rates of up to 56\%. In total, 6600km2 (30\%) of the farmland used during socialism was abandoned after 1991. Topography, soil type, and population variables were the most important predictors to explain substantial spatial variation in abandonment rates. However, many of our a priori hypotheses about the direction of variable influence were rejected. Most importantly, abandonment rates were higher in the plains and lower in marginal areas. The growing importance of subsistence farming in the transition period, as well as off-farm income and remittances likely explain these patterns. The breakdown of socialism appears to have resulted in fundamentally different abandonment patterns in the Western Ukraine, where abandonment was a result of the institutional and economic shock, compared to those in Europe's West, where abandonment resulted from long-term socio-economic transformation such as urbanization and industrialization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250. pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250. pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98\% and user's accuracies of 86\% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80\%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90\%. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Defoliators and bark beetles are natural disturbance agents in many forest ecosystems around the world. Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of insect disturbance dynamics can help in understanding their impacts on forest ecosystem resilience and functioning, and in developing adaptive management strategies. In recent years, much progress has been made in landscape-level analyses of insect-induced disturbances using remotely sensed data. However, many studies have focused on single insect agents or aggregated different insect agents into a single group. In this study, we characterized the temporal-spectral patterns associated with bark beetle and defoliator disturbances using Landsat time series between 1990 and 2013, with the objective to test if the two insect disturbances can be separated with Landsat data. We analyzed a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani Razowski) in British Columbia, Canada. To characterize the disturbance and recovery trends associated with insect disturbances we used the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm. We fitted LandTrendr spectral trajectories to annual normalized burn ratio (NBR) and Tasseled Cap (TC) time series, from which we then extracted a set of disturbance metrics. With these disturbance metrics, two random forest models were trained to a) distinguish insect disturbances from harvest and fire disturbances; and to b) attribute the insect disturbances to the most likely agent, i.e. mountain pine beetle or western spruce budworm. Insect disturbances were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 76.8\%, and agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 75.3\% to 88.0\%, depending on whether only pure host-stands or mixed stands with both insect hosts were considered. In the case of mixed host stands, nearly 45\% of the western spruce budworm disturbances were falsely attributed to mountain pine beetle. Spectral metrics describing disturbance magnitude were more important for distinguishing the two insect agents than the disturbance duration. Spectral changes associated with western spruce budworm disturbances had generally lower magnitudes than mountain pine beetle disturbances. Moreover, disturbances by western spruce budworm were more strongly associated with changes in TC greenness, whereas disturbances by mountain pine beetle were more strongly associated with changes in TC brightness and wetness. The results reflect the ephemeral nature of defoliators versus the tree mortality impacts of bark beetles in our study area.

	abstract = {A highly automated algorithm called vegetation change tracker (VCT) has been developed for reconstructing recent forest disturbance history using Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This algorithm is based on the spectral-temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2-3 h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80\% were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user's and producer's accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70\% and 60\% in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with no-change classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Water resource managers have introduced major changes to dam operations to meet increasing water demand for irrigation purposes in lowland areas. Climatic and land-cover scenarios for the next century indicate that the sustainability of the equilibrium between available resources and water demand will be seriously threatened.

It was shown that the difference in reflectance development between different types of forest plantations could be characterized by fitting a linear regression model through the bandwise spectral mean values for each stand, starting 5 years after the final felling. The coefficients of this regression model can be used to improve statistically based characterizations of young forest, compared to using data from the most recent image only.

	abstract = {A critical component of landscape dynamics is the recovery of vegetation following disturbance. The objective of this research was to characterize the forest recovery trends associated with a range of spectral indicators and report their observed performance and identified limitations. Forest disturbances were mapped for a random sample of three major bioclimate zones of North American boreal forests. The mean number of years for forest to recover, defined as time required to for a pixel to attain 80\% of the mean spectral value of the 2 years prior to disturbance, was estimated for each disturbed pixel. The majority of disturbed pixels recovered within the first 5 years regardless of the index ranging from approximately 78\% with normalized burn ratio (NBR) to 95\% with tasselled cap greenness (TCG) and after 10 years more than 93\% of disturbed pixels had recovered. Recovery rates suggest that normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) and TCG saturate earlier than indices that emphasize longer wavelengths. Thus, indices such as NBR and the mid-infrared spectral band offer increased capacity to characterize different levels of forest recovery. The mean length of time for spectral indices to recover to 80\% of the pre-disturbance value for pixels disturbed 10 or more years ago was highest for NBR, 5.6 years, and lowest for TCG, 1.7 years. The mid-infrared spectral band had the greatest difference in recovered pixels among bioclimate zones 1 year after disturbance, ranging from approximately 42\% of disturbed pixels for the cold and mesic bioclimate zone to 60\% for the extremely cold and mesic bioclimate zone. The cold and mesic bioclimate zone had the longest mean years to recover ranging from 1.9 years for TCG to 4.2 years for NBR, while the cool temperate and dry bioclimate zone had the shortest mean years to recover ranging from 1.6 years for TCG to 2.9 years for NBR suggesting differences in pre-disturbance conditions or successional processes. The results highlight the need for caution when selecting and interpreting a spectral index for recovery characterization, as spectral indices, based upon the constituent wavelengths, are sensitive to different vegetation conditions and will provide a variable representation of structural conditions of forests.},

In this study, we investigated the characteristics and evolution of a short reach in the headwater of the Ijuez River, central-southern Pyrenees. Assessment of a series of sedimentary and geomorphic structures confirmed major changes to the valley bottom, mainly related to changes in the intensity of human activity. The oldest sedimentary structure is a terrace level located 3 to 4m above the current alluvial plain. General deforestation, overgrazing and recurring fires in the montane belt (1100-1600ma.s.l.) have led to increased soil erosion and connectivity, and to the triggering of debris flows that have been deposited on the fluvial terrace. Woody fragments from within the debris flows were dated using accelerator mass spectrometry 14C radiocarbon techniques (AMS), yielding ages between 100 and 115cal years bp, which coincides with the period of maximum deforestation and human density in the Pyrenees. Depopulation and farmland abandonment since the beginning of the 20th century has resulted in generalized natural and artificial reforestation, a shrinkage of the eroded areas and a decline in connectivity between slopes and the channel. The most important consequence has been channel incision and narrowing, and the development of a sediment armour layer.

The combined use of both such models allows a set of predictors to be selected, which, when used with Random Forest, produce a map that is highly accurate for predicting abandonment and, when used with logistic regression, produce an interpretable model.

	abstract = {BackgroundGrasslands are a major part of the global ecosystem, covering 37 of the earth's terrestrial area. For a variety of reasons, mostly related to overgrazing and the resulting problems of soil erosion and weed encroachment, many of the world's natural grasslands are in poor condition and showing signs of degradation. This review examines their contribution to global food supply and to combating climate change.ScopeGrasslands make a significant contribution to food security through providing part of the feed requirements of ruminants used for meat and milk production. Globally, this is more important in food energy terms than pig meat and poultry meat. Grasslands are considered to have the potential to play a key role in greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in terms of global carbon storage and further carbon sequestration. It is estimated that grazing land management and pasture improvement (e.g. through managing grazing intensity, improved productivity, etc) have a global technical mitigation potential of almost 1·5 Gt CO2 equivalent in 2030, with additional mitigation possible from restoration of degraded lands. Milk and meat production from grassland systems in temperate regions has similar emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram of product as mixed farming systems in temperate regions, and, if carbon sinks in grasslands are taken into account, grassland-based production systems can be as efficient as high-input systems from a greenhouse gas perspective.ConclusionsGrasslands are important for global food supply, contributing to ruminant milk and meat production. Extra food will need to come from the world's existing agricultural land base (including grasslands) as the total area of agricultural land has remained static since 1991. Ruminants are efficient converters of grass into humanly edible energy and protein and grassland-based food production can produce food with a comparable carbon footprint as mixed systems. Grasslands are a very important store of carbon, and they are continuing to sequester carbon with considerable potential to increase this further. Grassland adaptation to climate change will be variable, with possible increases or decreases in productivity and increases or decreases in soil carbon stores. © 2012 The Author.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.05.003},
	abstract = {Throughout history, humans have transformed natural forests into agricultural land, settlement areas and managed forests. Studies on the dynamics of forest change are one of the mainstays in land change science. The forest transition theory offers a powerful tool to analyze changes in human interference with forests. At the national level, a range of factors have been found to influence a country's forest change. The role of international wood product trade has, however, rarely been studied based on empirical data. We offer a global assessment of how this trade helps shape observed forest change, by relating forest stock change to net trade of wood products for the period 1997-2007 and by localizing the origin of wood consumed in a given nation. For many nations, traded wood products have a relevant impact on the course of ongoing forest transitions. We develop a general typology of how wood product trade can influence forest change and place various nations within this framework. We find that many wealthy nations with returning forests seem to accelerate this return by importing wood products. These imports appear to be provided by two main types of wood exporters: (a) by wealthy countries with low population densities and stable forests and (b) by relatively poor countries with declining forests, employing increasing population and welfare levels. We discuss these findings in the light of general theories on land use transitions and forest change and conclude by highlighting implications for national forest policies and global environmental governance, aiming at reducing negative impacts of wood products and enhancing the positive role they can play in replacing more fossil fuel intensive products. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Questions: The co-existence of high numbers of species has always fascinated ecologists, but what and where are the communities with the world records for plant species richness? The species-area relationship is among the best-known patterns in community ecology, but does it give a consistent global pattern for the most saturated communities, the global maxima? Location: The world. Methods: We assembled the maximum values recorded for vascular plant species richness for contiguous areas from 1 mm2 up to 1 ha. We applied the power function to relate maximal richness to area and to make extrapolations to the whole Earth. Results: Only two community types contain global plant species maxima. The maxima at smaller spatial grain were from oligo- to meso-trophic, managed, semi-natural, temperate grasslands (e.g. 89 species on 1 m2), those at larger grains were from tropical rain forests (e.g. 942 species on 1 ha). The maximum richness values closely followed a power function with z = 0.250: close to Preston's 'canonical' value of 0.262. There was no discernable difference between maxima using rooted presence (i.e. including only plants rooted in the plot) vs shoot presence (i.e. including any plant with physical cover over the plot). However, shoot presence values must logically be greater, with the curves flattening out at very small grain, and there is evidence of this from point quadrats. Extrapolating the curve to the terrestrial surface of the Earth gave a prediction of 219 204 vascular plant species, surprisingly close to a recent estimate of 275 000 actual species. Conclusions: Very high richness at any spatial grain is found only in two particular habitat/community types. Nevertheless, these high richness values form a very strong, consistent pattern, not greatly affected by the method of sampling, and this pattern extrapolates amazingly well.

	doi = {10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.022},
	abstract = {The full greenhouse gas balance of nine contrasted grassland sites covering a major climatic gradient over Europe was measured during two complete years. The sites include a wide range of management regimes (rotational grazing, continuous grazing and mowing), the three main types of managed grasslands across Europe (sown, intensive permanent and semi-natural grassland) and contrasted nitrogen fertilizer supplies. At all sites, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was assessed using the eddy covariance technique. N2O emissions were monitored using various techniques (GC-cuvette systems, automated chambers and tunable diode laser) and CH4 emissions resulting from enteric fermentation of the grazing cattle were measured in situ at four sites using the SF6 tracer method. Averaged over the two measurement years, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) results show that the nine grassland plots displayed a net sink for atmospheric CO2 of -240 ± 70 g C m-2 year-1 (mean ± confidence interval at p {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.95). Because of organic C exports (from cut and removed herbage) being usually greater than C imports (from manure spreading), the average C storage (net biome productivity, NBP) in the grassland plots was estimated at -104 ± 73 g C m-2 year-1, that is 43\% of the atmospheric CO2 sink. On average of the 2 years, the grassland plots displayed annual N2O and CH4 (from enteric fermentation by grazing cattle) emissions, in CO2-C equivalents, of 14 ± 4.7 and 32 ± 6.8 g CO2-C equiv. m-2 year-1, respectively. Hence, when expressed in CO2-C equivalents, emissions of N2O and CH4 resulted in a 19\% offset of the NEE sink activity. An attributed GHG balance has been calculated by subtracting from the NBP: (i) N2O and CH4 emissions occurring within the grassland plot and (ii) off-site emissions of CO2 and CH4 as a result of the digestion and enteric fermentation by cattle of the cut herbage. On average of the nine sites, the attributed GHG balance was not significantly different from zero (-85 ± 77 g CO2-C equiv. m-2 year-1). The net exchanges by the grassland ecosystems of CO2 and of GHG were highly correlated with the difference in carbon used by grazing versus cutting, indicating that cut grasslands have a greater on-site sink activity than grazed grasslands. However, the net biome productivity was significantly correlated to the total C used by grazing and cutting, indicating that, on average, net carbon storage declines with herbage utilisation for herbivores. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1002/ldr.3209},
	abstract = {Reported potentials for sequestration of carbon in soils of agricultural lands are overly optimistic because they assume that all degraded cropland and grassland can be subjected to best management practices. Two approaches for estimating this potential are presented. Method 1 (M1) considers literature-derived best estimates for annual soil organic carbon (SOC) gains (Mg C ha−1) by bioclimatic zone; Method 2 (M2) assumes an annual C increase of 3 to 5 promille with respect to present SOC mass (similar to the French ‘4 pour mille' initiative). Four management scenarios are considered, capturing the varying level of plausibility of meeting the full technological potential. According to M1, achievable gains range from 0.05–0.12 Pg C yr−1 to 0.14–0.37 Pg C yr−1, with a technological potential of 0.32–0.86 Pg C yr−1. For M2, these are 0.07–0.12 Pg C yr−1, 0.21–0.35 Pg C yr−1, and 0.60–1.01 Pg C yr−1. Consideration of the technological potential only and use of a proportional annual increase in SOC (M2), rather than using best estimates for soil carbon gains by bioclimatic zone (M1), will provide too ‘bright a picture' in the context of rehabilitating degraded lands and mitigating/adapting to climate change. Further, M2 assumes that possible C gains will be greatest where present SOC stocks are highest, which is counter-intuitive. Although all measures aimed at increasing SOC content should be encouraged due to the creation of win-win situations, it is important to create a realistic picture of the amount of SOC gains that are feasible based on bioclimatic and management implementation constraints.},

The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands.

	abstract = {Forest stand structure is an important concept for ecology and planning in sustainable forest management. In this article, we consider that the incorporation of complementary multispectral information from optical sensors to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) may be advantageous, especially through data fusion by back-projecting the LiDAR points onto the multispectral image. A multivariate data set of both LiDAR and multispectral metrics was related with a multivariate data set of stand structural variables measured in a Scots pine forest through canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Four statistically significant pairs of canonical variables were found, which explained 83.0\% accumulated variance. The first pair of canonical variables related indicators of stand development, i.e. height and volume, with LiDAR height metrics. CCA also found attributes describing stand density to be related to LiDAR and spectral variables determining canopy coverage. Other canonical variables pertained to Lorenz curve-derived attributes, which are measures of within-stand tree size variability and heterogeneity, able to discriminate even-sized from uneven-sized stands. The most relevant result was to find that metrics derived from the multispectral sensor showed significant explanatory potential for the prediction of these structural attributes. Therefore, we concluded that metrics derived from the optical sensor have potential for complementing the information from the LiDAR sensor in describing structural properties of forest stands. We recommend the use of back-projecting for jointly exploiting the synergies of both sensors using similar types of metrics as they are customary in forestry applications of LiDAR.},

	abstract = {For millennia, mankind has shaped landscapes, particularly through agriculture. In Europe, the age-old interaction between humans and ecosystems strongly influenced the cultural heritage. Yet European farmland is now being abandoned, especially in remote areas. The loss of the traditional agricultural landscapes and its consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services is generating concerns in both the scientific community and the public. Here we ask to what extent farmland abandonment can be considered as an opportunity for rewilding ecosystems. We analyze the perceptions of traditional agriculture in Europe and their influence in land management policies. We argue that, contrary to the common perception, traditional agriculture practices were not environmentally friendly and that the standards of living of rural populations were low. We suggest that current policies to maintain extensive farming landscapes underestimate the human labor needed to sustain these landscapes and the recent and future dynamics of the socio-economic drivers behind abandonment. We examine the potential benefits for ecosystems and people from rewilding. We identify species that could benefit from land abandonment and forest regeneration and the ecosystem services that could be provided such as carbon sequestration and recreation. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with rewilding, including the need to maintain open areas, the fire risks, and the conflicts between people and wildlife. Despite these challenges, we argue that rewilding should be recognized by policy-makers as one of the possible land management options in Europe, particularly on marginal areas. © 2012 The Author(s).},

Changes in shrub abundance may alter ecosystem carbon (C) sequestration and storage, with potential positive or negative feedback on global C cycling. To assess potential implications of shrub expansion in different alpine plant communities, we compared C fluxes and pools in one Empetrum-dominated heath, one herb- and cryptogam-dominated meadow, and one Salix-shrub community in Central Norway. Over two growing seasons, we measured Gross Ecosystem Photosynthesis, Ecosystem Respiration (ER), and C pools for above-ground vegetation, litter, roots, and soil separated into organic and mineral horizons. Both the meadow and shrub communities had higher rates of C fixation and ER, but the total ecosystem C pool in the meadow was twice that of the shrub community because of more C in the organic soil horizon. Even though the heath community had the lowest rates of C fixation, it stored one and a half times more C than the shrub community. The results indicate that the relatively high above-ground biomass sequestering C during the growing season is not associated with high C storage in shrub-dominated communities. Instead, shrub-dominated areas may be draining the carbon-rich alpine soils because of high rates of decomposition. These processes were not shown by mid-growing season C fluxes, but were reflected by the very different distribution of C pools in the three habitats.},

The 3-dimensional Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model generated a fuel type LiDAR signature library. These simulations provided reference endmembers and additional data to demonstrate the feasibility to classify fuel types using spectral matching algorithms, like multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) and spectral angle mapper (SAM). When choosing a single endmember per fuel type, MESMA outperformed SAM with 63.3\% and 48.9\% agreement, respectively. Multiple endmembers per fuel type improved the classification results to 85.3\% in SAM and 86.5\% in MESMA. Endmembers need to identify different scan angles that account for the variability in height and number of trees for better results.

This study relates the Pinus halepensis Miller forest residual biomass (FRB), estimated in 192 field plots, to several independent variables extracted from Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data in Aragón region (Spain). Five selection approaches and four non-parametric regression methods were compared to estimate FRB. The sample was divided into training and validation sets, composed of 144 and 48 plots, respectively. The best-fitted model was obtained using the Support Vector Machine method with the radial kernel. The model included three ALS metrics: the 70th percentile, the variance of the return heights, and the percentage of first returns above mean height. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) after validation was 8.85 tons ha−1. The influence of point density, scan angle, canopy pulse penetration, terrain slope, and shrub presence in model performance was assessed using graphical and statistical approaches. Point densities higher than 1 point m−2, scan angles lower than 15°, canopy pulse penetration over 25\%, and terrain slopes under 30\% generated a smaller variability in mean predictive error (MPE) values, thus increasing model accuracy in 0.56, 1.94, 1.44, and 5.47 tons ha−1, respectively. Shrub vegetation caused greater variability in MPE values but slightly decreased model accuracy (0.10 tons ha−1). No statistically significant differences were found between the categories in the influencing variables, except for canopy pulse penetration. The mapping of Pinus halepensis Miller FRB using the best-fitted model summed up a total of 3,627,021.25 tons, which equals to 1,584.91 thousand tonnes of oil (ktoe).},

	abstract = {The socio-economic impacts of environmental stresses associated with global environmental change depend to a large extent on how societies organize themselves. Research on climate-related societal impacts, vulnerability and adaptation is currently underdeveloped, prompting international global environmental change research institutions to hold a series of meetings in 2009-2010. One of these aimed at identifying needs in middle-income and low-income countries (MLICs), and found that effective responses to the challenge of reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptation will drive research and policy into challenging and innovative areas of research. Producing impacts, vulnerability and adaptation knowledge requires greater inclusion of MLIC researchers and a rethinking of the research structures, institutions and paradigms that have dominated global change research to date. Scientific literature discussed in this article suggests that governance issues need to become central objects of empirically based, detailed, multiscalar and action-oriented research, and that this needs to address the politically sensitive and seemingly intractable issue of reducing global inequities in power and resource distribution. The scientific literature suggests that without effective action in those directions, current trends toward greater inequality will continue to both reflect and intensify global environmental threats and their impacts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Analyzing temporal changes in forest amount and configuration is paramount to better design future forest management interventions. Such analyses are especially required for tropical biomes, which are usually subject to dynamic and heterogeneous land uses. Recent studies have suggested that many tropical biomes are passing through the process of “forest transition”, i.e. an overall change from forest loss to forest gain. However, this hypothesis remains scarcely tested, due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed, quantitative historical records of forest cover. In this study, we investigate 38 years of land use change in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, from 1976 to 2014, using multitemporal datasets from aerial photographs and satellite images. We classified the historical series to produce land use maps and calculated a set of landscape metrics, including total forest cover, patch size, patch shape and patch connectivity. Our results indicated non-linear changes through time in forest loss and gain and also in landscape structure, which can be classified into two distinct periods. The first period (1976–1996) was marked by expressive forest loss and fragmentation, whereas the second (1996–2014) was characterized by a much less intense forest dynamics, with little deforestation being balanced by forest regeneration. We attribute the forest dynamics observed to temporal changes in socioeconomic factors, such as an increasing human settlements and changes in environmental protection policies. Our results show that current forests are a heterogeneous mosaic of forests with different ages, and support the hypothesis that forest transition is occurring in Atlantic Forest landscapes.},

The independent predictor was induced based on the literature review and theories, and an ordinary least square (OLS) estimator will be used to develop multiple linear regression models.

An allometric equation of this research was developed using carbon stocks as dependent variables, and four of the predictor's variables: diameter at breast height (DBH); total height observed at field (hF); total height derived from airborne lidar (hL); and morphometric variables of the crown projection area (CPA). Based on the statistic indicators, the most suitable model is Model 1, ln (Sc) =–β0 + β1 ln (hL) + β2 ln (DBH) + β3 ln (CPA) for the combination of remote sensing and field observation; ln (Sc) =–β0 + β1 ln (hF) + β2 ln (DBH) for field inventory only; and ln (Sc) =–β0 + β1 ln (hL) + β2 ln (CPA) for remote sensing only.

Unsupervised and supervised classifications were carried out with the final classification done using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier for each period image to create six dominant land-use and land-cover classes (LULC) which included: shrubland, grassland, bare land, open forest, agriculture and settlement, closed forest, and wetland. The results showed that, between 1990 and 2010, the closed forest area had reduced from 19,599 to 9275 ha (−52.7\%), open forest from 30,214 to 7345 ha (−75.7\%), and shrubland from 83,288 to 65,212 ha (−21.7\%).

(4) The higher the rank of KRD land is, the lower the change rate of KRD land will be. (5) Moderate KRD land had the fastest change frequency and was feasible to change to another type.

	abstract = {Forest inventory attributes are an important source of information for a variety of strategic and tactical forest management purposes. However, it is not possible or feasible for field inventories to be conducted contiguously across large areas, especially at a resolution fine enough to be useful for operational management. Therefore, a large number of quantitative modeling and prediction methods have been and are being developed and applied to predict and map forest attributes, with the goal of providing an accurate, spatially continuous, and detailed information base for practitioners of forestry and ecosystem management. This article reviews the most commonly used prediction techniques in the context of a comprehensive modeling framework that includes a discussion of methods, data sources, variable selection, and model validation. The methods discussed include regression, nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, decision trees, and ensembles such as random forest. No single technique is revealed as universally superior for predicting forest inventory attributes; the ideal approach depends on goals, available training and ancillary data, and the modeler's interest in tradeoffs between realism and statistical considerations. Useful ancillary data included in the models tend to include climate and topographic variables as well as vegetation indices derived from optical remote sensing systems such as Landsat. However, the use of airborne LiDAR in modeling of forest inventory attributes is increasing rapidly and shows promise for operational forest management applications. Different considerations are encapsulated within a generalized model development framework that provides a structure against which tradeoffs can be evaluated. © 2014 Society of American Foresters.},

	abstract = {To meet obligations under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand is required to estimate, in an unbiased manner, forest carbon stock change, over the Protocol's first commitment period (2008-2012). New Zealand has three categories of forest, namely: natural forest; forests planted prior to 1990; and forests planted in non-forest land after 1990. Carbon credits can be earned from net carbon accumulated in the last forest category: these forests are referred to as ‘Kyoto forests'. A plot-based forest carbon inventory system, which relies on the use of airborne scanning LiDAR, has been developed for Kyoto forests. Circular plots, 0.06 ha in area, will be located within these forests on a systematic 4 km grid. The inventory design requires minimal forest plot measurements because access to these post-1990 forests is not guaranteed. This paper describes the investigations that have been undertaken to confirm the relationship at the plot scale between LiDAR variables and (a) forest carbon, and (b) the key inputs (namely, height, basal area, age, and silvicultural) to a New Zealand specific forest growth model. The paper will also describe some considerations for an operational forest carbon inventory system which will be implemented in early 2008.},

The results show that coarse resolution remotely sensed data in combination with relevant topographic and climate data can be used to map above-ground biomass with good accuracy over large areas. For the data sets considered, empirical models based on a 2 percent sample explained 73 percent of the variance in biomass in the remaining 98 percent of the data with a root mean square error of 44.4 tons/ha.

	abstract = {To meet Kyoto Protocol obligations, New Zealand is required to estimate forest carbon stock change over the first commitment period (2008-2012). New Zealand has three subcategories of forest, namely: Natural forest; Pre-1990 forest; and Post-1989 forest. The Post-1989 forest carbon inventory undertaken in 2008 used discrete return airborne LiDAR and ground-based measurements of 0.06. ha circular plots located on a 4-km × 4-km grid. The national carbon stock estimate was based on a double sampling scheme consisting of 246 plots from which both ground and LiDAR data were obtained, supplemented with 46 additional plots assessed using only LiDAR. This paper describes the relationships established between carbon stocks estimated using ground-based measurements and LiDAR metrics. A regression model explaining 74\% of the variation in total carbon was developed using LiDAR 30th percentile height (P30ht) and canopy cover (\%Cover). The regression estimator improved the precision of the national carbon stock estimate in 2008 by 6\% compared to the ground-based estimate. This inventory indicates that it is possible to reduce the cost of obtaining carbon stock estimates to a specified level of precision using a combination of ground-based and LiDAR measurements in a double sampling approach. The theoretical maximum improvement in precision expected in 2012, when additional LiDAR data are expected to be available, is 50-55\%. © 2011.},

	abstract = {Carbon exists as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and constitutes about 0.04\% of the atmosphere. In the recent past, it has gained a lot of attention as a greenhouse gas, as it has potential to influence the climate pattern of the world. Anthropogenic activities like industrialisation, deforestation, forest degradation and burning of fossil fuel, has caused an increase in the level of carbon in the atmosphere and disrupted the global carbon cycle. However, nature has its own mechanism of sequestering and storing the carbon in its “reservoirs” or “sinks”. Forest plays an important role in the global carbon cycle as carbon sinks of the terrestrial ecosystem. The carbon sequestered or stored on the forest trees are mostly referred to as the biomass of the tree or forest. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified five carbon pools of the terrestrial ecosystem involving biomass, namely the aboveground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, woody debris and soil organic matter. Among all the carbon pools, the above-ground biomass constitutes the major portion of the carbon pool. Estimating the amount of forest biomass is very crucial for monitoring and estimating the amount of carbon that is lost or emitted during deforestation, and it will also give us an idea of the forest's potential to sequester and store carbon in the forest ecosystem. Estimations of forest carbon stocks are based upon the estimation of forest biomass. Forest's carbon stocks are generally not measured directly; however, many authors assume the carbon concentration of tree parts to be 50\% or 45\% of the dry biomass. This paper, aims to review and summarise the various methods and studies that were carried out to estimate the above-ground biomass of the forest.},

This transect was covered by ALS data and field data from 238 plots. AGB was modeled using different types of predictor variables, namely ALS metrics, variables related to growing conditions (elevation, latitude, and climatic variables), and tree species information. Modelling of AGB in the long transect covering diverse mountainous forest conditions was challenging: the RMSE values were rather large (37\%–70\%). The effects of growing conditions on model predictions were minor. However, species information was essential to improve accuracy. The analysis revealed that when doing inventories of spruce-dominated areas, all plots should be pooled together when the models are developed, whereas if pine or deciduous species dominate the area in question, separate dominant species-wise models should be constructed.},

	abstract = {A random forest (RF) predictor is an ensemble of individual tree predictors. As part of their construction, RF predictors naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure between the observations. One can also define an RF dissimilarity measure between unlabeled data: the idea is to construct an RF predictor that distinguishes the "observed" data from suitably generated synthetic data. The observed data are the original unlabeled data and the synthetic data are drawn from a reference distribution. Here we describe the properties of the RF dissimilarity and make recommendations on how to use it in practice. An RF dissimilarity can be attractive because it handles mixed variable types well, is invariant to monotonic transformations of the input variables, and is robust to outlying observations. The RF dissimilarity easily deals with a large number of variables due to its intrinsic variable selection; for example, the Addcl1 RF dissimilarity weighs the contribution of each variable according to how dependent it is on other variables. We find that the RF dissimilarity is useful for detecting tumor sample clusters on the basis of tumor marker expressions. In this application, biologically meaningful clusters can often be described with simple thresholding rules. © 2006 American Statistical Association.},

In many developed countries socioeconomic changes have induced forest expansion during the last centuries, with still seldom explored implications for ecosystem services. We assessed the growth rate and the contribution of these “new forests” on C storage under the imprint of land-use history from Mediterranean to temperate forests in two biogeographical regions in the Iberian Peninsula, using data from 6422 plots of the Spanish National Forest Inventory (1986–2007) and the land-cover map of 1956 to distinguish among pre-existing and new forests (appeared after 1956). Almost a quarter of current forests were new forests and they represented 22\% of the total C pool. New forests maintained similar C stocks than pre-existing ones (∼45 Mg ha−1), but they are growing at rates 25\% faster. Considering the whole Spanish forested territory, the new forest growth rate would offset around 9\% of the rate of total C emitted in Spain between 1986 and 2007. The effects of land-use history on forest growth and C stocks varied with environmental conditions (for example, growth of new forests in areas with less water availability was higher than in pre-existing ones), supporting the idea that agricultural legacies may prevail in the long term. In a time when European forests exhibit the first signs of carbon sink saturation, our study endows a relevant ecological role to new forests appearing in the second half of the twentieth century.},

A linear equation between TLS derived parameters and field measured values were established, which gave the coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.79 and 0.96 for tree height and DBH, respectively.

The plots included a range of genetic types established on north- and south-facing aspects. Modelled carbon was highly correlated with directly measured crown, stem, and above ground biomass data, with r = 0.92, 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. LiDAR canopy percentile height (P30) and cover, based on all returns above 0.5 m, explained 81, 88, and 93\% of the variation in directly measured crown, stem, and above ground live carbon and 75, 89 and 88\% of the modelled carbon, respectively. LAI (all surfaces) ranged between 8.8-19.1 in the 10 plots measured at age 9 years. The difference in canopy percentile heights (P95-P30) and cover based on first returns explained 80\% of the variation in total LAI. Periodic mean annual increments in stem volume, above ground live carbon, and total carbon between ages 9 and 13 years were significantly related to (P95-P30), with regression models explaining 56, 58, and 55\%, respectively, of the variation in growth rate per plot. When plot aspect and genetic type were included with (P95-P30), the R2 of the regression models for stem volume, above ground live carbon, and total carbon increment increased to 90, 88, and 88\%, respectively, which indicates that LiDAR regression equations for estimating stock changes can be substantially improved by incorporating supplementary site and crop data. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Lidar transforms how we map ecosystems, but its prospect for measuring ecosystem dynamics is limited by practical factors, such as variation in lidar acquisition and lack of ground data. To address practical use of multitemporal lidar for forest and carbon monitoring, we conducted airborne lidar surveys four times from 2002 to 2012 over a region in Scotland, and combined the repeat lidar data with field inventories to map tree growth, biomass dynamics, and carbon change. Our analyses emphasized both individual tree detection and area-based, grid-level approaches. Lidar-detected heights of individual trees correlated well with field values, but with noticeable underestimation biases (r = 0.94, bias = −1.5 m, n = 598) due to the increased probability of missing treetops as pulse density decreases. If not corrected for such biases, lidar provided unrealistic or wrong estimates of tree growth unless laser sampling rates were high enough (e.g., {\textbackslash}textgreater 7 points/m2). Upon correction, lidar could detect sub-annual tree growth (p-value {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). At grid levels, forest biomass density was reliably estimated from area-based lidar metrics by both Random Forests (RF) and a linear functional model (r {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.86, RMSEcv {\textbackslash}textless 21 Mg/ha), irrespective of laser sampling rates. But RF constantly overfit the data, often with poorer predictions. The better generality of the linear model was further confirmed by its transferability—fitted for one year but applicable to other years—a strength not possessed by RF but desired to alleviate the reliance on ground biomass data for model calibration. Resultant lidar maps of forest structure captured canopy dynamics and carbon flux at fine scales, consistent with growth histories and known disturbances. The entire 20-km2 study area sequestered carbon at a rate of 0.59 ± 0.4 Mg C/ha/year. Overall, our study describes robust techniques well suited for multitemporal lidar analysis and affirms the utility and potential of repeat lidar data for resource monitoring and carbon management; however, the full potential cannot be attained without the support of accompanying field surveys or modeling efforts in enhancing stakeholders' trustworthiness of lidar-based inference.},

	abstract = {Wildfires in the Mediterranean are strongly tied to human activities. Given their particular link with humans, which act as both initiators and suppressors, wildfire hazard is highly sensitive to socioeconomic changes and patterns. Many researchers have prompted the perils of sustaining the current management policy, the so-called ‘total fire exclusion’. This policy, coupled to increasingly fire-prone weather conditions, may lead to more hazardous fires in the mid-long run. Under this framework, the irruption of the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the ongoing situation. Facing the lack of an effective treatment, the only alternative was the implementation of strict lockdown strategies. The virtual halt of the system undoubtedly affected economic and social behavior, triggering cascading effects such as the drop in winter-spring wildfire activity. In this work, we discuss the main impacts, challenges and consequences that wildfire science may experience due to the pandemic situation, and identify potential opportunities for wildfire management. We investigate the recent evolution of burned area (retrieved from the MCD64A1 v006 MODIS product) in the EU Mediterranean region (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) to ascertain to what extent the 2020 winter-spring season was impacted by the public health response to COVID-19 (curfews and lockdowns). We accounted for weather conditions (characterized using the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPEI6) to disregard possible weather effects mediating fire activity. Our results suggest that, under similar drought-related circumstances (SPEI6 ≈ −0.7), the expected burned area in 2020 during the lockdown period in the EU (March–May) would lay somewhere within the range of 38,800 ha ± 18,379 ha. Instead, the affected area stands one order of magnitude below average (3325 ha). This stresses the need of considering the social dimension in the analysis of current and future wildfire impacts in the Mediterranean region.},

	abstract = {Canopy height is an excellent indicator of forest productivity, biodiversity and other ecosystem functions. Yet, we know little about how elevation drives canopy height in mountain areas. Here we take advantage of an ambitious airborne LiDAR flight plan to assess the relationship between elevation and maximum forest canopy height, and discuss its implications for the monitoring of mountain forests’ responses to climate change. We characterized vegetation structure using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data provided by the Spanish Geographic Institute. For each ALS return within forested areas, we calculated the maximum canopy height in a 20 × 20 m grid, and then added information on potential drivers of maximum canopy height, including ground elevation, terrain slope and aspect, soil characteristics, and continentality. We observed a strong, negative, piece-wise response of maximum canopy height to increasing elevation, with a well-defined breakpoint (at 1623 ± 5 m) that sets the beginning of the relationship between both variables. Above this point, the maximum canopy height decreased at a rate of 1.7 m per each 100 m gain in elevation. Elevation alone explained 63\% of the variance in maximum canopy height, much more than any other tested variable. We observed species- and aspect-specific effects of elevation on maximum canopy height that match previous local studies, suggesting common patterns across mountain ranges. Our study is the first regional analysis of the relationship between elevation and maximum canopy height at such spatial resolution. The tree-height decline breakpoint holds an intrinsic potential to monitor mountain forests, and can thus serve as a robust indicator to appraise the effects of climate change, and address fundamental questions about how tree development varies along elevation gradients at regional or global scales.},

	abstract = {Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography. Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140–142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

	abstract = {Secondary succession (SS) is one of the main consequences of the abandonment of agricultural and forestry practices in rural areas, causing -among other processes- woody encroachment on former pastures and croplands. In this study we model and monitor the spatial evolution of SS over semi-natural grassland communities in the mountain range of the Pyrenees in Spain, during the last 36 years (1984-2019). Independent variables for ‘annual-based’ and ‘period-based’ modeling were drawn from a suite of Surface Reflectance Landsat images, LandTrendr (LT)-algorithm-adjusted images and LT outputs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained and tested using all possible variable combinations of all the aforementioned datasets. The best modeling strategy involved yearly time series of LT-adjusted Tasseled Cap Brightness (TCB) and Wetness (TCW) axes as predictors, attaining a F1-score of 0.85, a Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.67 and an AUC 0.83. Woodlands encroached above 480,000 ha of grasslands and crops during the study period. A model using LT outputs for the whole period also denoted good performance (F1-score = 0.85, MCC = 0.75) and estimated a similar area of woodland expansion ({\textasciitilde}509,000 ha), but this ‘period’ approach was unable to provide temporal information on the year or the encroachment dynamics. Our results suggest an overall proportion of 66\% for the Pyrenees being affected by SS, with higher intensity in the west-central part, decreasing towards the eastern end.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Mountain regions in Western Europe have gone through a massive rural–urban migration and the collapse of their traditional socioeconomic system. As a result, forest has occupied many old pastures and croplands. In protected areas – such as National Parks – changes in the landscape can affect biodiversity and other services, including the values that motivated their declaration. Any policy decision in these areas requires quantifying the extent and impact of land-cover changes and their consequences on landscape structure and functioning. In this study we analyze the patterns of change in forest cover during six decades in three mountain National Parks in Spain. Our aim is to quantify those patterns, their effects on the landscape, and discuss the potential consequences for the main natural values and services. We assessed changes in forest cover through reclassification of aerial ortophotographs taken in 1956–57 (past images) and 2016–17 (recent images). The three Parks show a relatively low change in total forest area (+5–10\%), and a much larger increase in dense forest (+20–30\%), with an important effect of land-use legacies, and similar patterns of landscape homogenization. There were fewer but larger forest patches in 2016 than in 1956, and most of the gain in dense forest occurred in core areas (+20\%), while transition areas such as edges, bridges or loops decreased between 30 and 55\%. Given their potential consequences on biodiversity and other services, these patterns of land-cover change and landscape configuration should be explicitly considered when designing the sustainable management of abandoned landscapes in protected areas.},

	abstract = {Understanding what environmental drivers control the position of the alpine tree line is important for refining our understanding of plant stress and tree development, as well as for climate change studies. However, monitoring the location of the tree line position and potential movement is difficult due to cost and technical challenges, as well as a lack of a clear boundary. Advanced remote sensing technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) offer significant potential to map short individual tree crowns within the transition zone despite the lack of predictive capacity. Process-based forest growth models offer a complementary approach by quantifying the environmental stresses trees experience at the tree line, allowing transition zones to be defined and ultimately mapped. In this study, we investigate the role remote sensing and physiological, ecosystem-based modeling can play in the delineation of the alpine tree line. To do so, we utilize airborne LiDAR data to map tree height and stand density across a series of altitudinal gradients from below to above the tree line within the Swiss National Park (SNP), Switzerland. We then utilize a simple process-based model to assess the importance of seasonal variations on four climatically related variables that impose non-linear constraints on photosynthesis. Our results indicate that all methods predict the tree line to within a 50 m altitudinal zone and indicate that aspect is not a driver of significant variations in tree line position in the region. Tree cover, rather than tree height is the main discriminator of the tree line at higher elevations. Temperatures in fall and spring are responsible for the major differences along altitudinal zones, however, changes in evaporative demand also control plant growth at lower altitudes. Our results indicate that the two methods provide complementary information on tree line location and, when combined, provide additional insights into potentially endangered forest/grassland transition zones.},

	abstract = {Despite the need for preserving the carbon pools in fire-prone southern European landscapes, emission reductions from wildfire risk mitigation are still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated expected carbon emissions and carbon credits from fuel management projects ongoing in Catalonia (Spain). The planning areas encompass about 1000 km2 and represent diverse fire regimes and Mediterranean forest ecosystems. We first modeled the burn probability assuming extreme weather conditions and historical fire ignition patterns. Stand-level wildfire exposure was then coupled with fuel consumption estimates to assess expected carbon emissions. Finally, we estimated treatment cost-efficiency and carbon credits for each fuel management plan. Landscape-scale average emissions ranged between 0.003 and 0.070 T CO2 year−1 ha−1. Fuel treatments in high emission hotspots attained reductions beyond 0.06 T CO2 year−1 per treated ha. Thus, implementing carbon credits could potentially finance up to 14\% of the treatment implementation costs in high emission areas. We discuss how stand conditions, fire regimes, and treatment costs determine the treatment cost-efficiency and long-term carbon-sink capacity. Our work may serve as a preliminary step for developing a carbon-credit market and subsidizing wildfire risk management programs in low-revenue Mediterranean forest systems prone to extreme wildfires.},
