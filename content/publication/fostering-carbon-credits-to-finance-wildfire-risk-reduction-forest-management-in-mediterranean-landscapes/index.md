abstract: Despite the need for preserving the carbon pools in fire-prone
  southern European landscapes, emission reductions from wildfire risk
  mitigation are still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated expected
  carbon emissions and carbon credits from fuel management projects ongoing in
  Catalonia (Spain). The planning areas encompass about 1000 km 2 and represent
  diverse fire regimes and Mediterranean forest ecosystems. We first modeled the
  burn probability assuming extreme weather conditions and historical fire
  ignition patterns. Stand-level wildfire exposure was then coupled with fuel
  consumption estimates to assess expected carbon emissions. Finally, we
  estimated treatment cost-efficiency and carbon credits for each fuel
  management plan. Landscape-scale average emissions ranged between 0.003 and
  0.070 T CO2 year −1 ha −1. Fuel treatments in high emission hotspots attained
  reductions beyond 0.06 T CO2 year −1 per treated ha. Thus, implementing carbon
  credits could potentially finance up to 14% of the treatment implementation
  costs in high emission areas. We discuss how stand conditions, fire regimes,
  and treatment costs determine the treatment cost-efficiency and long-term
  carbon-sink capacity. Our work may serve as a preliminary step for developing
  a carbon-credit market and subsidizing wildfire risk management programs in
  low-revenue Mediterranean forest systems prone to extreme wildfires.
