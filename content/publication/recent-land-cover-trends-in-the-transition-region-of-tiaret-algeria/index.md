abstract: The transition zone between the Tellian and Saharan Atlas of the
  Tiaret region in Algeria is believed to be undergoing land degradation
  processes because of the increase in population needs, which causes a
  weakening of the biological potential and generates ecological and
  socio-economic imbalances. The lack of periodically acquired data on land
  cover is a major handicap to understand and diagnose the state of this
  transition zone. The goal of our work was to reconstruct past annual land
  cover changes in order to assess the best monitoring tools for the current and
  future situations. We used an annual series of Landsat images, acquired
  between 1984 and 2017 via the Google Earth Engine platform. We then classified
  relevant land covers by applying a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
  algorithm to this multi-spectral data set. We also integrated other derived
  data such as vegetation, water and color indices, texture measures and TC
  transformationsin order to improve classification accuracy. The resulting 34
  high-resolution land cover maps for the 1984â€“2017 period precisely
  characterize the recent dynamics and status of the transition zone of the
  Tellian and Saharan Atlas in the steppe region of Tiaret, and allow to explore
  land cover and climatic trends.
