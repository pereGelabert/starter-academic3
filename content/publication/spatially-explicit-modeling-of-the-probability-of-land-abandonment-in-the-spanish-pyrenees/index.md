abstract: Many mountain regions in Europe have experienced massive migrations
  towards metropolitan areas, with far-reaching implications for societies and
  the environment, especially croplands and grasslands. In this work, we
  tailored a geospatial framework to envisage the probability of land
  abandonment in the Spanish Pyrenees at moderate spatial resolution. We
  predicted the likelihood of land abandonment combining machine learning
  algorithms, geospatial data and historical observations of land abandonment in
  the period 1980 to 2019. The model attained a high predictive performance (AUC
  = 0.85) at a moderate resolution (30 m), providing insights into the spatial
  behavior of the potential for both abandonment and its main driving forces.
  The highest rates of abandonment were found in rural settlements and towns in
  bottom valleys where tourism and recreational activities have proliferated
  over the years. Fast and comfortable connections between the main metropolitan
  areas (e.g. Barcelona and Zaragoza) and the mountain regions foster touristic
  activity and lead to the creation of new settlements. Ecotourism and mountain
  sports promote land abandonment as evidenced by the high probability predicted
  over the Central Pyrenees (from Pallars Jussà to Alto Gállego counties). Our
  results provide spatially explicit probability and uncertainty outputs,
  providing insights into site-specific abandonment potential and the influence
  of its drivers. These results can substantially assist land planners in
  decision-making, enabling assessments at local scale.
