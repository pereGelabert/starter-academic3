abstract: Wildfires in the Mediterranean are strongly tied to human activities.
  Given their particular link with humans, which act as both initiators and
  suppressors, wildfire hazard is highly sensitive to socioeconomic changes and
  patterns. Many researchers have prompted the perils of sustaining the current
  management policy, the so-called ‘total fire exclusion’. This policy, coupled
  to increasingly fire-prone weather conditions, may lead to more hazardous
  fires in the mid-long run. Under this framework, the irruption of the COVID-19
  pandemic adds to the ongoing situation. Facing the lack of an effective
  treatment, the only alternative was the implementation of strict lockdown
  strategies. The virtual halt of the system undoubtedly affected economic and
  social behavior, triggering cascading effects such as the drop in
  winter-spring wildfire activity. In this work, we discuss the main impacts,
  challenges and consequences that wildfire science may experience due to the
  pandemic situation, and identify potential opportunities for wildfire
  management. We investigate the recent evolution of burned area (retrieved from
  the MCD64A1 v006 MODIS product) in the EU Mediterranean region (Portugal,
  Spain, France, Italy and Greece) to ascertain to what extent the 2020
  winter-spring season was impacted by the public health response to COVID-19
  (curfews and lockdowns). We accounted for weather conditions (characterized
  using the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPEI6)
  to disregard possible weather effects mediating fire activity. Our results
  suggest that, under similar drought-related circumstances (SPEI6 ≈ −0.7), the
  expected burned area in 2020 during the lockdown period in the EU (March–May)
  would lay somewhere within the range of 38,800 ha ± 18,379 ha. Instead, the
  affected area stands one order of magnitude below average (3325 ha). This
  stresses the need of considering the social dimension in the analysis of
  current and future wildfire impacts in the Mediterranean region.
