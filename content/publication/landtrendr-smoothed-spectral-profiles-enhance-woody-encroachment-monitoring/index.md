abstract: Secondary succession (SS) is one of the main consequences of the
  abandonment of agricultural and forestry practices in rural areas, causing
  -among other processes- woody encroachment on former pastures and croplands.
  In this study we model and monitor the spatial evolution of SS over
  semi-natural grassland communities in the mountain range of the Pyrenees in
  Spain, during the last 36 years (1984-2019). Independent variables for
  ‘annual-based’ and ‘period-based’ modeling were drawn from a suite of Surface
  Reflectance Landsat images, LandTrendr (LT)-algorithm-adjusted images and LT
  outputs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained and tested
  using all possible variable combinations of all the aforementioned datasets.
  The best modeling strategy involved yearly time series of LT-adjusted Tasseled
  Cap Brightness (TCB) and Wetness (TCW) axes as predictors, attaining a
  F1-score of 0.85, a Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.67 and an AUC
  0.83. Woodlands encroached above 480,000 ha of grasslands and crops during the
  study period. A model using LT outputs for the whole period also denoted good
  performance (F1-score = 0.85, MCC = 0.75) and estimated a similar area of
  woodland expansion (~509,000 ha), but this ‘period’ approach was unable to
  provide temporal information on the year or the encroachment dynamics. Our
  results suggest an overall proportion of 66% for the Pyrenees being affected
  by SS, with higher intensity in the west-central part, decreasing towards the
  eastern end.
